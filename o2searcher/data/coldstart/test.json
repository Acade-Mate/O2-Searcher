For natural language processing (NLP) tasks, techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and the removal of stop words are crucial for preparing text data, enhancing the model's ability to understand and process language effectively. The effectiveness of preprocessing methods can vary significantly depending on the specific task and model architecture, with some studies suggesting that more sophisticated methods like subword tokenization and contextualized embeddings can lead to better performance in large language models (LLMs) compared to traditional approaches.\nStructured data models, such as those used in relational databases, are optimized for tabular data with predefined schemas, enabling efficient querying and transactional operations, whereas natural language processing (NLP) models are designed to handle unstructured text data, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and language translation, which require understanding the semantic and syntactic nuances of human language.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of NLP models that have been trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate human-like text and perform a wide range of language tasks, while traditional NLP models often rely on hand-crafted features and smaller, more domain-specific datasets, which can limit their generalizability but enhance their performance on specific tasks.\n\nThe architectural differences between models for structured data and NLP are reflected in their training processes and deployment requirements; structured data models typically require less computational power and can be trained and deployed on standard hardware, whereas NLP models, especially LLMs, demand significant computational resources, including specialized hardware like GPUs and TPUs, due to their large parameter sizes and complex training algorithms.\nTraining large models on structured data often encounters significant computational and resource limitations, necessitating powerful hardware and efficient algorithms to handle the vast amounts of data and complex model architectures. These limitations can lead to increased training times and higher costs, which can be prohibitive for organizations with limited budgets or access to advanced computing resources.\n\nData quality and preprocessing are critical challenges in training large models on structured data. Poor data quality, including missing values, inconsistencies, and noise, can severely impact model performance. Effective preprocessing techniques, such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, are essential to ensure that the model can learn meaningful patterns from the data.\n\nSecurity and compliance issues pose significant risks when training large models on structured data, especially in industries handling sensitive information. Ensuring data privacy and adhering to regulatory requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, can add complexity to the training process. Organizations must implement robust security measures and data governance practices to mitigate these risks.\nLLM benchmarks are crucial for evaluating the performance of large language models on structured data tasks, focusing on metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and precision-recall curves, which help in understanding the model's ability to generalize and handle imbalanced datasets. The Kolena platform provides comprehensive tools for benchmarking LLMs, offering granular insights through metrics such as robustness, fairness, and adversarial testing, which are essential for identifying model weaknesses and biases.

The data architecture framework typically comprises six notable components: data sources, data storage, data processing, data integration, data governance, and data consumption, each playing a critical role in the overall data management strategy. Key best practices for data architecture include aligning with business goals, ensuring scalability and flexibility, and implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive data.\nData preprocessing significantly enhances the performance of large models in handling structured data by reducing noise, handling missing values, and normalizing data, which can lead to a 10-30% improvement in model accuracy. Effective preprocessing techniques, such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and feature scaling, are crucial for transforming categorical and numerical data into formats that large models can efficiently process, ensuring that the models can capture complex patterns and relationships within the data. Advanced preprocessing methods, including dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE, can further optimize model performance by reducing the computational load and improving the interpretability of the data, particularly in high-dimensional datasets.\nTraining large AI models on structured data requires significant computational resources, often necessitating specialized hardware such as high-performance GPUs and TPUs to handle the massive computational load and large memory requirements. This hardware not only increases the initial capital expenditure but also the ongoing operational costs, including power consumption and cooling systems. Efficient resource management and optimization techniques, such as mixed precision training and model parallelism, are essential to mitigate these challenges and ensure scalable and cost-effective training processes.\n\nDeploying large models in production environments presents additional challenges, particularly in ensuring low latency and high throughput for real-time applications. This often requires optimizing the model architecture and leveraging inference-specific hardware like inference accelerators. Techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation can significantly reduce the model size and computational requirements without compromising performance, making it feasible to deploy these models on a wider range of devices, including edge devices with limited resources.\n\nThe integration of large models with existing IT infrastructure is complex and requires robust data pipelines and scalable storage solutions to handle the vast amounts of structured data. This includes the need for efficient data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines, as well as robust monitoring and logging systems to track model performance and ensure data integrity. Companies often need to invest in advanced data management tools and platforms to streamline these processes and ensure seamless integration with their existing workflows.\nLarge models have been successfully utilized by financial institutions to predict market trends with high accuracy, leveraging structured data from historical transactions, economic indicators, and news feeds. For instance, JPMorgan Chase implemented a machine learning model that processed and analyzed vast amounts of structured financial data, resulting in a 20% improvement in predictive accuracy for stock price movements.\n\nIn the healthcare sector, deep learning models have been employed to enhance patient outcomes by analyzing structured electronic health records (EHRs). A notable example is the work done by Google's DeepMind, which integrated EHR data from multiple hospitals to predict patient deterioration with 95% accuracy, significantly reducing hospital readmission rates and improving patient care.\n\nRetail companies have leveraged large models to optimize inventory management and supply chain operations by analyzing structured sales data, customer behavior, and supplier information. Walmart, for example, implemented an advanced analytics system that processed structured data from its vast retail network, leading to a 15% reduction in stockouts and a 10% improvement in inventory turnover.\nLarge language models (LLMs) exhibit significantly different performance metrics when applied to structured data tasks compared to natural language tasks, with LLMs generally outperforming on natural language tasks due to their training data and architecture optimized for language understanding and generation. In structured data tasks, LLMs often struggle with precision and recall, particularly in tasks requiring high accuracy in data manipulation and query execution, where specialized models or traditional SQL-based systems typically perform better. The performance gap is further exacerbated in real-world applications where structured data is often noisy and requires robust error handling and data cleaning, areas where LLMs are less adept compared to domain-specific models.</learnings>\n"

This approach allows GNNs to effectively handle tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, making them particularly suitable for applications in social networks, recommendation systems, and chemical compound analysis.\n\nAttention mechanisms tailored for tabular data enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant features by dynamically weighting the importance of different columns or rows. This technique, often implemented through self-attention or transformer architectures, improves the interpretability and performance of models in tasks such as classification, regression, and anomaly detection. Notable examples include the TabTransformer and the SAINT model, which have demonstrated significant improvements over traditional methods in various tabular datasets.\n\nAdvanced GNN architectures, such as Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and GraphSAGE, incorporate attention mechanisms to prioritize the influence of neighboring nodes during the message-passing phase. This enhancement allows the model to better capture local and global graph structures, leading to improved performance in tasks that require understanding the hierarchical and relational aspects of the data, such as community detection and recommendation systems.\nTraining large language models (LLMs) on structured data requires significant computational resources, and one key challenge is the efficient utilization of limited hardware. Techniques such as mixed precision training can significantly reduce memory usage and accelerate training times by using both 32-bit and 16-bit floating-point numbers, thereby enabling the training of larger models on less powerful hardware.\n\nModel parallelism is another critical optimization technique that addresses the limitations of single-device memory and computational capacity. By partitioning the model across multiple devices, model parallelism allows for the training of models that exceed the memory limits of a single GPU or CPU, thus enabling the scaling of model sizes and improving overall training efficiency.\n\nEfficient data loading and preprocessing are essential for optimizing the training process of large models. Techniques like data sharding, where the dataset is divided into smaller chunks that are processed in parallel, and asynchronous data loading, which ensures that data is ready for the next training step without idle GPU time, can significantly enhance the throughput and reduce the overall training time.\nLarge models in finance have demonstrated significant improvements in fraud detection, with one prominent case being JPMorgan Chase's implementation of a machine learning model that reduced false positives by 40% while increasing the detection rate of genuine fraud cases by 20%. This model processed vast amounts of structured transaction data, leading to more accurate and efficient fraud management.\n\nIn the healthcare industry, Google's DeepMind has successfully applied large models to predict patient deterioration, specifically in the context of acute kidney injury. By analyzing historical patient data, the model achieved a 90% accuracy rate in predicting the condition 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, significantly improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital readmission rates by 15%.\n\nRetail giants like Walmart have leveraged large models to optimize inventory management and supply chain logistics. By integrating real-time sales data, weather forecasts, and historical trends, Walmart's AI system has reduced out-of-stock items by 30% and improved forecast accuracy by 25%, leading to a 5% increase in overall sales efficiency.\nLarge language models (LLMs) generally exhibit lower precision, recall, and F1 scores on structured data tasks compared to specialized models, highlighting a significant gap in their performance when dealing with highly structured and domain-specific data.\n\nSpecialized models, designed for specific tasks such as entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and structured data extraction, consistently outperform LLMs in terms of precision and recall, with some studies reporting precision improvements of up to 20% and recall improvements of up to 15% in structured data tasks.\n\nThe performance metrics of LLMs on structured data tasks are highly sensitive to the quality and quantity of training data, with fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets leading to substantial improvements in F1 scores, sometimes by as much as 10-15%, although this often requires significant computational resources and domain expertise.\nIntegrating large language models with existing IT infrastructure requires a robust data pipeline that can handle high volumes of structured data efficiently, ensuring minimal latency and maximum throughput. Cutting-edge infrastructure best practices for enterprise AI data management emphasize the use of hybrid cloud solutions, leveraging both on-premises and cloud resources to optimize cost and performance, while ensuring data security and compliance. Effective monitoring systems are essential for real-time performance tracking and anomaly detection, enabling proactive maintenance and continuous optimization of the integrated AI models and data pipelines.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The process of EU economic integration began with the Treaty of Rome in 1957, which established the European Economic Community (EEC) to promote economic cooperation among member states through a common market and customs union. This process reached new heights with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, formally establishing the European Union (EU) and setting the four freedoms of the single market: the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people.\n\nKey measures for EU economic integration include the establishment of a monetary union, particularly the introduction of the euro in 1999 and its full circulation in 2002. This initiative not only boosted trade and investment among member states but also enhanced the EU's position in the global economy. Additionally, the EU has strengthened market integration and improved economic efficiency and competitiveness through various policies and regulations, such as the Single European Act and the Services Directive.\n\nThe results of EU economic integration have been significant, with increased trade and investment among member states, higher economic growth, and improved employment rates. For example, since the establishment of the single market in 1993, intra-EU trade has tripled, making it one of the largest single markets globally. The introduction of the euro has reduced transaction costs, stabilized prices, and increased transparency, providing a solid foundation for economic stability and growth in member states.\nOne of the main challenges the EU faces in promoting diplomatic and defense unity is the differing interests and priorities among member states, leading to significant divisions in formulating and implementing a common security and defense policy. For instance, some member states prefer to rely on NATO, while others seek to strengthen the EU's own defense capabilities. These divisions are particularly evident in key decision-making processes, such as defense investment and participation in joint military operations.\n\nThe EU's security strategy is gradually shifting from traditional crisis management and conflict prevention towards a more comprehensive strategic autonomy. This transformation includes strengthening the EU's own military capabilities, enhancing responses to new areas like cyber defense and space security, and promoting cooperation among member states through a common defense market and research projects. In recent years, the EU has introduced several policies and mechanisms, such as Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF), to support this transition.\n\nDespite progress in promoting diplomacy and defense unity, the actual effectiveness of these efforts is still constrained by funding and resource allocation. Differences in defense budgets and investments among EU member states, as well as insufficient financial support for common defense projects, affect the EU's ability to act and influence on the international stage. Additionally, the EU still relies heavily on close cooperation with NATO and the United States in addressing complex security challenges, such as terrorism and hybrid threats.\nSignificant differences in economic interests among member states lead to friction and challenges in the unification process. For example, there are substantial disparities in economic development levels and industrial structures among different member states, with some countries relying on export-oriented economies and others on resources and services. This disparity makes it difficult to formulate unified economic policies.\n\nDifferences in diplomatic interests also impact the unification process of member states. Member states have varying positions and diplomatic strategies in international politics, with some countries favoring close ties with specific major powers and others seeking multilateral balanced diplomacy. This difference complicates coordination and consistent action among member states when facing external pressures and international affairs.\n\nDifferences in defense interests further complicate the unification process. There are clear divisions among member states regarding defense policies and security strategies, with some advocating for stronger autonomous defense capabilities and others relying on collective security mechanisms. These divisions create obstacles in security cooperation and military integration, affecting mutual trust and cooperation among member states.\nThe international environment significantly influences the EU's unification process, with external pressures and international cooperation playing a crucial role. U.S. trade policies and geopolitical pressures, such as tariff threats and NATO defense spending requirements during the Trump administration, heightened tensions within the EU and prompted it to strengthen internal unity and autonomy. Meanwhile, China's investments and trade cooperation in Europe, especially through the Belt and Road Initiative, have provided new growth points for the EU but also raised concerns about economic dependence and security risks.\n\nIn response to changes in the international environment, the EU actively seeks multilateral cooperation with other countries and regions to enhance its global influence. Negotiations on trade and investment agreements with African, Asian, and Latin American countries, as well as active participation in multilateral institutions like the UN, demonstrate the EU's efforts to address global issues such as climate change and migration crises through cooperation. These collaborations not only boost the EU's international standing but also support its internal unification process.\n\nExternal pressures and international cooperation have had a profound impact on the EU's policy-making and internal reforms. In the face of challenges from major powers like the U.S. and China, the EU has strengthened strategic planning in areas such as economic security, digital sovereignty, and energy transition, as seen in the EU Economic Security Strategy and the European Green Deal. These policies aim to enhance the EU's competitiveness and autonomy while reflecting its role and responsibility in global governance.\nThe main institutions of the EU include the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank. These institutions play distinct roles in the decision-making process and power distribution, collectively forming the internal political structure of the EU. The European Parliament is primarily responsible for legislation and budget approval, the European Council plays a key role in strategic direction and major decisions, the European Commission is the executive body that proposes legislation and implements EU policies, and the European Central Bank is responsible for monetary policy in the Eurozone.\n\nIn the context of the Ukraine crisis, the internal political structure of the EU has had a significant impact on economic, diplomatic, and defense unification. This crisis has prompted the EU to strengthen internal coordination and policy unity, particularly in energy security and defense cooperation. The EU has demonstrated its capacity for unified action in response to external threats through economic sanctions against Russia, enhanced cooperation with NATO, and reforms to the internal energy market.\n\nThe flexibility of the decision-making process and the balance of power distribution are key features of the EU's internal political structure. Despite disagreements among member states on certain issues, the EU ensures policy coherence and effectiveness through multi-level consultation and decision-making mechanisms, such as the co-decision procedure and qualified majority voting. This mechanism is particularly important in handling complex international affairs, helping the EU achieve a higher degree of unity in economic, diplomatic, and defense areas.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>EU member states generally seek to enhance economic integration through the common market and trade policies, but there are differences in specific interests among countries. For example, Germany and France tend to push for a deeper economic union, while Eastern European countries focus more on market access and attracting investment. These differences often complicate negotiations in the EU's internal policy-making process.\n\nIn the field of diplomacy, EU member states tend to take a common stance when facing global challenges, but there are disagreements on specific strategies. For instance, France and Germany advocate strengthening the EU's autonomous diplomatic capabilities and promoting a greater role for the EU in global governance. After Brexit, other member states like Poland and Hungary rely more on U.S. security guarantees and diplomatic support.\n\nIn the defense sector, EU member states have outlined a new blueprint for common defense through documents such as the 'Strategic Compass,' emphasizing the enhancement of autonomous defense capabilities and reducing dependence on the United States. However, there are significant differences in defense spending and specific military cooperation projects among countries. Germany and France play leading roles in EU defense projects, while some smaller member states focus more on specific security threats, such as the military threat from Russia that is of particular concern to Eastern European countries.\n\nThe influence of the United States and China on the EU's unification process in the economic domain is significant. China has strengthened its economic ties with EU member states through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, boosting bilateral trade and investment growth. The United States, through negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), sought to strengthen economic cooperation with the EU, although the negotiations ultimately did not reach an agreement. However, the United States continues to indirectly influence EU economic decisions through other bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, such as NATO and the G7.\n\nIn the field of diplomacy, both the United States and China influence the EU's unification process through different diplomatic strategies. The United States emphasizes traditional alliances with the EU, particularly in security and defense cooperation, reinforcing strategic trust through joint military exercises and security dialogues under the NATO framework. China, through the '17+1' cooperation mechanism, strengthens cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries, attempting to form political and economic forces favorable to China within the EU, which to some extent affects EU internal unity.\n\nIn the defense sector, the United States has had a profound impact on the EU's defense integration process. Through common defense and security policies under the NATO framework, the United States has pushed EU member states to increase defense spending and enhance military capabilities. At the same time, the United States remains cautious about the construction of the EU's autonomous defense capabilities, fearing that EU defense integration may weaken NATO's role. China's influence in this area is relatively small, but by participating in UN peacekeeping operations and maritime security cooperation, it is gradually increasing its influence in international security affairs, which also affects the EU's considerations in defense policy to some extent.\n\nThe EU's decision-making procedures mainly include legislative procedures, co-decision procedures, and special legislative procedures. In the legislative procedure, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU jointly participate to ensure the democracy and representativeness of legislation. The co-decision procedure involves equal powers of the European Parliament and the Council, while special legislative procedures apply to specific areas such as agriculture and taxation, where the Council has more power.\n\nPower distribution within the EU has a multi-level structure, primarily divided into supranational institutions and intergovernmental institutions. Supranational institutions include the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the European Court of Justice, which play important roles in legislation, implementation, and judiciary. Intergovernmental institutions such as the European Council and the Council of the EU coordinate policies and decisions among member states, ensuring a balance of national interests.\n\nInternal reforms of the EU's mechanisms are ongoing to adapt to political, economic, and social changes. Key areas of reform include improving decision-making efficiency, enhancing democratic legitimacy, and strengthening cooperation among member states. Recent reform measures include increasing the power of the European Parliament, simplifying legislative procedures, and enhancing transparency to boost public trust and support for the EU.\n\nThe EU's response to the Ukraine crisis has highlighted its limitations in foreign and security policy. Despite multiple foreign ministers reaffirming support for Ukraine, the EU lacks unity and decisiveness in practical actions, failing to form strong military or economic sanctions to effectively curb the escalation of conflict.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis has exacerbated divisions among EU member states, particularly in economic and defense policies. For example, Germany and France have clear differences in balancing relations with Russia and supporting Ukraine, affecting the overall policy coordination and implementation effectiveness of the EU.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis has driven further integration in the EU's security and defense sectors, despite slow progress and numerous challenges. The crisis has prompted EU member states to recognize the importance of strengthening common defense capabilities, such as through mechanisms like the European Defense Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), to reduce dependence on the United States and enhance their own autonomy in security matters.\n\nThere are significant regional differences in the specific financial support provided by EU member states for defense investments and common defense projects. For example, Germany and France, as core EU countries, have been leaders in defense investment, significantly increasing their military budgets and providing substantial funding for EU common defense projects. In contrast, Eastern and Southern European countries, due to weaker economic strength, have lower defense investments, but these countries also show active participation in specific defense projects, especially within the NATO common defense framework.\n\nThe improvement of the EU's defense capabilities largely depends on coordination and cooperation among member states. Although the EU has made progress in defense integration, conflicts of interest and strategic goal differences among member states remain major obstacles. For example, France and Germany have a consistent stance on defense autonomy, driving the implementation of projects like the 'European Defense Fund,' while some smaller member states rely more on NATO protection and are cautious about EU defense autonomy. This divergence to some extent limits the comprehensive enhancement of the EU's defense capabilities.\n\nEfforts towards EU defense autonomy have been significantly influenced by external environments, particularly changes in Russian and U.S. policies. Increased military activities by Russia in Eastern and Northern Europe have heightened security concerns among EU member states, prompting these countries to increase defense spending, especially Eastern European countries. Meanwhile, U.S. demands for increased defense spending by NATO members are also pushing EU countries to invest more. These external factors not only accelerate the process of EU defense autonomy but also encourage member states to cooperate more actively in common defense projects to address shared security threats.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Germany's foreign policy adjustments in the post-Merkel era, especially towards China, show a more pragmatic and multilateralist tendency. The new government maintains economic cooperation with China while emphasizing concerns in areas such as human rights, technology transfer, and intellectual property protection, reflecting Germany's attempt to balance economic interests and values.\n\nFrance, during Biden's term, places greater emphasis on coordinating and unified actions with the EU in its policy towards China, striving for dialogue and cooperation within a multilateral framework. France actively promotes a consistent stance among EU members on China policy, particularly in trade, investment, and technological cooperation, to enhance the EU's collective influence and negotiation power.\n\nCentral and Eastern European countries (such as Poland and Hungary) exhibit different policy orientations in the process of EU integration, especially in economic and diplomatic fields. Poland and Hungary have reservations about the EU's fiscal rules and rule of law standards, leading to friction with core EU member states, which affects the EU's unity in key policy areas, particularly in budget allocation and institutional reforms.\nThe influence of the United States and China on EU member states is evident in economic, diplomatic, and defense areas: Trump's trade policies significantly pressured Germany and France's auto exports, causing tension in EU-US trade relations. Meanwhile, China's increased investment in Central and Eastern European countries like Poland and Hungary through the 'Belt and Road' initiative has enhanced these countries' economic dependence on China, affecting internal EU policy coordination.\n\nIn the diplomatic field, the US's influence on EU member states is waning, especially in Germany and France, where there are significant differences with the US over NATO defense spending. At the same time, China's active participation in the UN and multilateral institutions has elevated its status in international affairs, particularly in climate change and global governance, leading to closer cooperation with EU countries.\n\nIn the defense sector, the US's security commitment to EU member states remains important, but the 'America First' policy under the Trump administration eroded trust within NATO. China, through joint military exercises and security dialogues with EU member states, is gradually increasing its military presence in Europe, especially in Central and Eastern European countries, where this trend is more pronounced.\nThe EU's decision-making procedures and power distribution mechanisms are highly complex, primarily involving institutions such as the European Council, the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Court of Justice. The European Council sets overall policy directions, the European Commission, as the sole proposer, proposes legislation and ensures the implementation of EU laws, the European Parliament co-decides on legislation and budgets with the Council, and the European Court of Justice interprets and enforces EU laws to ensure consistency across all member states.\n\nIn the process of economic unification, the EU has significantly increased economic integration among member states through the implementation of the common market and the single currency (euro). The common market eliminates tariffs and trade barriers between member states, promoting the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people, while the use of the euro reduces transaction costs, enhances price transparency, and boosts trade and investment.\n\nIn the process of diplomatic and defense unification, the EU has gradually strengthened coordination and cooperation among member states through mechanisms such as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). The CFSP aims to formulate and implement a common foreign policy, manage international crises and conflicts, while the CSDP focuses on military and civilian operations, including peacekeeping, crisis management, and security support missions, which help enhance the EU's influence and operational capabilities in international affairs.\nThe Ukraine crisis has led Germany, France, Poland, and Hungary to adopt different strategies in economic, diplomatic, and defense policies, reflecting the EU's internal divisions and coordination challenges in crisis response. Germany, heavily dependent on Russian energy, faces dual pressures from economic sanctions and shows caution in defense spending and military involvement. France seeks to play a mediating role diplomatically while pushing for EU defense autonomy to reduce reliance on the US.\n\nPoland and Hungary have taken starkly different positions in the Ukraine crisis. Poland firmly supports Ukraine, strengthens cooperation with NATO, and increases its defense budget, while Hungary, due to its energy and economic ties with Russia, adopts a more cautious and neutral stance. These differences among member states further highlight the EU's challenges in unifying policies, especially in economic sanctions and military actions.\n\nZelensky's reception at the White House and his 'royal treatment' in the UK reflect the complex attitudes of European countries towards the Ukraine issue and their desire to play a larger role in the situation. The UK's high-level reception and firm support for Ukraine contrast sharply with the US's stance, indicating that Europe is seeking greater autonomy and influence in foreign and security policies to reduce dependency on the US.\nThe EU's 'European Defense White Paper' outlines a series of visions for strengthening defense, emphasizing aid to Ukraine as a critical factor in advancing EU defense integration. The white paper also details specific financial support from EU member states for defense investments and common defense projects, demonstrating the EU's determination and action in enhancing its defense capabilities.\n\nGermany plays a key role in EU defense integration, particularly in 'European Security Integration.' Germany's defense investments and financial support for common defense projects have significantly increased, showing its willingness and ability to take on a leadership role. However, Germany's actions in defense policy face multiple internal and external challenges, including fiscal pressure and lack of political consensus.\n\nFrance also plays a leading role in EU defense integration, especially in promoting common defense projects and increasing member states' defense investments. France's defense budget continues to grow, and it holds a central position in multiple defense projects, such as 'European Sky Eye' (Skyranger) and 'Future Combat Air System' (FCAS). Cooperation between France and Germany is crucial in enhancing EU defense capabilities, but there are still differences in specific projects and strategic directions that need further coordination.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The provided contents do not contain specific information about the economic, diplomatic, and defense policies of Germany, France, Poland, and Hungary, particularly regarding their policies toward China and Russia. Therefore, I am unable to extract the requested key learnings from the given text. Additional sources are needed to address the query comprehensively.\nTrump 2.0 may intensify economic competition between China and the U.S. in Europe, especially affecting Germany and France, which are the engines of the European economy. The Trump administration might pressure these countries through tariffs and trade agreements to reduce their dependence on China and increase investment and trade with the U.S. This strategy could impact bilateral trade balances and potentially affect the process of economic integration within Europe.\n\nIn the diplomatic arena, Trump 2.0 may increase efforts to court Central and Eastern European countries like Poland and Hungary, leveraging their complex attitudes toward the EU and Russia to push for greater reliance on the U.S. in security and energy matters. This diplomatic strategy could weaken the EU's cohesion, particularly in its common stance against Russia.\n\nIn the defense sector, Trump 2.0 may demand that Germany, France, Poland, and Hungary increase their defense spending to ease the burden on the U.S. This would not only add fiscal pressure to these countries but could also lead to political and social discontent domestically. At the same time, the U.S. might strengthen military cooperation with these countries by providing advanced military technology and equipment, further solidifying its military presence in Europe.\nThe EU's decision-making process heavily relies on coordination among its main institutions, including the European Council, the European Commission, and the European Parliament. These institutions play a crucial role in the unification processes of economic, diplomatic, and defense policies, with the European Council setting the overall political direction, the European Commission proposing legislation and ensuring its implementation, and the European Parliament having legislative veto power and budget approval authority.\n\nThe distribution and coordination mechanisms among member states are critical in the EU's unification process. The EU ensures equal participation of member states in the legislative process through common decision-making procedures (such as the ordinary legislative procedure) and balances the interests of large and small states through specific voting rules (such as qualified majority voting). This mechanism is particularly evident in economic integration and foreign policy formulation, but it still faces significant challenges in the defense sector, as defense matters involve the core sovereignty of member states.\n\nThe unification process of the EU's foreign and defense policies is significantly influenced by external factors, such as geopolitical pressures from the U.S. and Russia. The EU addresses these challenges through the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), but differences in interests and strategic goals among member states still constrain the effectiveness and consistency of these policies.\nGermany, France, Poland, and Hungary have taken clear supportive measures in the Ukraine crisis, including providing military aid, economic support, and diplomatic mediation. The foreign ministers of these countries have repeatedly reaffirmed their firm support for Ukraine, emphasizing the importance of unity and coordinated action within the EU.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis has accelerated Europe's re-evaluation of 'strategic autonomy,' particularly in the defense and security sectors. Germany and France have proposed initiatives to strengthen defense cooperation within the EU, aiming to reduce dependence on the U.S. and NATO and enhance the EU's own military capabilities and response capabilities. Poland and Hungary have also expressed support for this direction, although they differ in their specific policy positions.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis has had a significant impact on the EU's economic and diplomatic unification process, highlighting the need for collaboration among member states in facing common challenges. Economically, the EU has strengthened economic coordination among member states, especially through common fiscal policies and financial support to address the economic shocks caused by the crisis. Diplomatically, the EU has shown high consistency in sanctions and diplomatic pressure against Russia, although individual countries still have differences in specific measures.\nGermany and France play a key 'twin-engine' role in the EU's defense integration, driving the autonomy and integration of European defense policies. Their specific financial support for defense investments and joint defense projects demonstrates this leadership, such as the European Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) and the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), major defense projects co-funded by Germany and France, showcasing deep cooperation in technology and finance.\n\nAlthough Germany and France share common goals in promoting EU defense integration, they have differences in specific defense policies. Germany tends to focus more on transparency in defense budgets and multilateral cooperation, while France emphasizes national sovereignty and defense autonomy. These policy differences are particularly evident in the allocation of defense budgets and the prioritization of defense projects, such as France's strong push for autonomous defense projects contrasting with Germany's cautious approach.\n\nThe publication of the EU Defense White Paper demonstrates the EU's strategic determination to achieve defense autonomy, with Germany and France playing a key role as major member states. The White Paper proposes a series of specific measures, including increasing defense investment, strengthening cooperation among member states, and advancing joint defense projects. Germany and France have played important roles in formulating and implementing these measures, laying the foundation for the future development of EU defense policy.</learnings>\n"

Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Microsoft Windows line. It runs as a graphical, 16-bit multi-tasking shell on top of an existing MS-DOS installation.

The intricate internal contradictions make it difficult to quell the turmoil. Religious conflicts not only exacerbate social divisions but also lead to the rise of extremism and terrorism, further threatening regional security. Historical colonial rule and external interventions have intensified the internal contradictions of Middle Eastern countries, making religious and ethnic issues more complex and affecting the stability and governance capabilities of political systems.\n\nThe strategic competition between China and the United States in the Middle East has increased political uncertainty in the region. Traditionally, the U.S. has had extensive military and political influence in the Middle East, while China has increased its presence in the region through the 'Belt and Road' initiative and economic cooperation. This competition may lead to greater fragmentation in the strategic choices of Middle Eastern countries, affecting regional political stability.\n\nThe varying degrees of dependence on China and the U.S. by Middle Eastern countries have exacerbated internal political divisions. The U.S. dominates in terms of security and military aid, while China provides support in economic and infrastructure development. This dual dependency may lead to the fragmentation of internal political forces, affecting national governance and policy consistency.\n\nThe policy differences and conflicting goals between China and the U.S. in the Middle East may trigger geopolitical tensions within the region. The U.S. tends to achieve its strategic goals through military intervention and sanctions, while China advocates resolving disputes through economic cooperation and diplomatic means. These policy differences may exacerbate instability in the region, making it more challenging for Middle Eastern countries to respond to external interventions.\n\nThere is a complex relationship between economic development levels and political stability in the Middle East. Economic diversification and growth in non-oil sectors are key factors in promoting political stability, but a single-economy structure dependent on oil resources exacerbates economic fragility and political instability. For example, countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have improved political stability and social welfare through economic diversification and attracting foreign investment, while countries like Iran and Iraq face greater political risks due to their single-economy structures and external sanctions.\n\nSocial inequality and youth unemployment are major drivers of political instability in the Middle East. High unemployment rates, wealth disparities, and unequal access to education lead to social discontent and political unrest. For example, the Arab Spring movements in Egypt and Tunisia were partly driven by high youth unemployment and increasing social inequality, which acted as catalysts in political upheavals.\n\nExternal interventions and geopolitical competition have exacerbated political instability in the Middle East. Conflicts of interest and military interventions by major powers such as the U.S., Russia, and China, as well as geopolitical competition among regional powers like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, have further destabilized the region. For instance, the multi-party interventions in the Syrian civil war and international negotiations over the Iranian nuclear issue reflect the impact of external forces on Middle Eastern political stability.\n\nIran's water resource issues not only involve domestic distribution and management but also cross borders, affecting relations with neighboring countries. Iran shares rivers and water resources with Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey, and the management and utilization of these transboundary water bodies often lead to conflicts and tensions, especially during droughts and water shortages. Frequent transboundary water conflicts not only exacerbate regional political instability but also affect international relations and the global water politics landscape.\n\nClimate risks in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are increasing, including extreme droughts, water shortages, and frequent sandstorms. These climate risks not only severely impact agriculture and economic development but also exacerbate social and political instability. For example, part of the cause of the Syrian civil war was attributed to long-term drought leading to agricultural collapse and mass population displacement, which further intensified social conflicts and political unrest.\n\nWater resource allocation in the Middle East is not only an environmental and economic issue but also a complex political one. The scarcity and uneven distribution of water resources exacerbate political tensions and conflicts within the region, particularly between Israel, Palestine, and Jordan. Water disputes between these countries not only affect domestic political stability but also pose a threat to peace and security in the entire region.\n\nThe political stability of the Middle East is deeply influenced by its complex historical background and cultural factors, especially the artificial division of national boundaries due to long-term colonial rule and external interventions. These boundaries often ignore the natural distribution of ethnic and religious groups, thereby exacerbating internal conflicts and political instability. For example, the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916 divided the Middle East into spheres of influence for Britain and France, leading to the formation of modern Middle Eastern states but also sowing the seeds for long-term conflicts.\n\nCultural factors play a crucial role in the political stability of the Middle East, with religion and tribalism being two primary cultural factors. In terms of religion, the long-standing opposition between Shia and Sunni Islam, as seen in the civil wars in Iraq and Syria, is particularly evident. Tribalism plays a significant role in countries like Saudi Arabia and Yemen, where tribal leaders often hold important influence in local politics, challenging the authority of central governments.\n\nEconomic factors also play a significant role in the political stability of the Middle East, especially the distribution and control of oil resources. Oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran maintain political stability through oil revenues, but this dependence also makes them vulnerable to fluctuations in international oil prices. For example, the sharp drop in international oil prices in 2014 led to fiscal pressures in these countries, exacerbating social discontent and political unrest.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Youth unemployment is a major threat to political stability in the Middle East, with high unemployment rates leading to social discontent and political unrest. For example, youth unemployment rates in Egypt and Tunisia are 29% and 35%, respectively, and these countries have experienced frequent protests and political turmoil.\nInequality in social structures has exacerbated political instability in the Middle East, where income disparities and uneven resource distribution have led to social stratification. In Saudi Arabia and Iran, the income gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, causing widespread public dissatisfaction and social unrest.\nThe evolution of the situation in North Africa not only affects the stability of the African continent but also has profound implications for Sino-African relations. For instance, the Libyan civil war has led to a large influx of refugees into Europe, increasing regional security pressures, and Chinese investments and projects in the region face significant risks.\nThe historical background and cultural factors of the Middle East significantly impact political stability, especially during geopolitical changes at the beginning of the new century. For example, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 not only overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime but also intensified sectarian conflicts in the region, leading to long-term instability in Iraq. This event highlighted the impact of external intervention and internal sectarian tensions on political stability.\nReligious factors play a crucial role in Middle Eastern politics, particularly in shaping political trends and mobilizing the public. For example, after the Iranian Islamic Revolution, the rise of Shia political forces had a profound impact on countries like Lebanon, Iraq, and Bahrain. These Shia communities gradually became important political forces, altering the regional power balance and leading to confrontations with Sunni states.\nCultural factors, especially nationalism and tribalism, also play a significant role in the political stability of the Middle East. In countries like Yemen and Libya, tribal structures and local nationalism have severely weakened the authority of central governments, leading to national fragmentation and civil wars. These factors not only hinder state-building but also provide opportunities for external interference, further exacerbating regional instability.\nIn the cross-border water conflict of the Jordan River, issues of water resource allocation have intensified tensions between Israel and Palestine, leading to multiple military conflicts and political crises. For example, the Six-Day War in 1967 was partly due to disputes over water resources. Water scarcity has not only affected agricultural and industrial development in both countries but also increased social and economic instability.\nIran's water crisis not only impacts domestic political stability but also affects its relations with neighboring countries. Overdevelopment and poor management of water resources in Iran have led to severe droughts and ecological damage in several regions, such as the drying up of Lake Urmia. These environmental issues have sparked domestic protests and social unrest, and have also influenced water-sharing agreements between Iran and its neighbors, including Turkey and Iraq.\nThe unequal structural power relationship between Israel and Palestine further exacerbates the challenges of water governance. Israel dominates water resource management and allocation, while Palestine is in a passive position. This power imbalance severely restricts Palestine's use of water resources, affecting its economic and social development, especially in the Gaza Strip, where water shortages have led to serious public health and humanitarian crises.\nHigh temperatures and drought in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have exacerbated water scarcity, leading to reduced agricultural yields and rising food prices, which in turn cause social discontent and political unrest. For example, prolonged drought in Syria has led to mass migration of farmers to cities, increasing urban social and economic pressures, and ultimately becoming an important factor in the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011.\nClimate risks have intensified resource competition, particularly for water resources, leading to tensions and conflicts between countries. For example, disputes over Nile River water resources between Egypt and Ethiopia have become more acute due to climate change, with negotiations often reaching impasses, increasing the risk of regional instability.\nClimate change has had a significant impact on health in the MENA region, with high temperatures and extreme weather events increasing the risk of disease transmission, further weakening public health systems. For example, heatwaves caused by extreme temperatures have resulted in numerous deaths and health issues in countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, putting additional pressure on health systems, affecting government governance capabilities and public satisfaction.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The internal religious and ethnic conflicts in the Middle East have led to long-term political instability, such as the conflict between Shiites and Sunnis in the Syrian civil war, which has exacerbated the complexity and violence of the situation. These conflicts not only involve religious sects but also include the struggle for autonomy or independence by ethnic minorities like the Kurds, further weakening national unity and stability.\n\nChina has played a positive role in promoting reconciliation in the Middle East. Through diplomatic efforts and economic cooperation, China has mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia, leading to the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries. This has not only alleviated regional tensions but also enhanced China's international reputation in its Middle East policy.\n\nThere are significant differences between U.S. and Chinese policies in the Middle East. The U.S. often achieves its strategic goals through military intervention and sanctions, while China tends to promote regional stability through economic investment and diplomatic mediation. These policy differences reflect the different interests and strategic considerations of the two countries in the Middle East, influencing their influence and role in the region.\nChina's Middle East policy is primarily driven by the 'Belt and Road' initiative, which aims to promote regional cooperation and economic development. However, it faces challenges from the U.S.' Cold War mentality. U.S. policy in the Middle East focuses on maintaining geopolitical advantages through military intervention and economic sanctions, which curb China's influence in the region and negatively impact political stability. For example, U.S. sanctions on Iran have heightened tensions in the Middle East and limited economic cooperation between China and Iran.\n\nRussia's policy in the Middle East emphasizes geopolitical and military involvement, particularly its support and military aid in the Syrian civil war. This intervention has solidified Russia's influence in the Middle East but has also had complex effects on regional political stability. For instance, Russia's military operations in Syria have helped stabilize the Assad government but have also led to significant humanitarian crises and ongoing regional conflicts.\n\nThe policies and interventions of the U.S., China, and Russia in the Middle East show that actions by external powers often exacerbate political instability in the region. While pursuing their own interests, these major powers overlook the autonomy of local states and the complexities within the region, leading to increased political tensions and conflicts. For example, the U.S. military intervention and regime change in Iraq, China's economic expansion under the 'Belt and Road' initiative, and Russia's military involvement in Syria have all had profound impacts on the political stability of the Middle East.\nThe geopolitical competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia has intensified political instability in the Middle East, especially in proxy wars in countries like Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon. This competition extends beyond the military domain to economic, religious, and cultural aspects, further complicating the region's political landscape.\n\nTurkey's rise in the Middle East and its geopolitical competition with Iran and Saudi Arabia reflect the struggle for influence among emerging regional powers. Turkey has demonstrated its independence and proactivity in regional affairs by supporting the Syrian opposition and taking a stance in the Qatar crisis, which has heightened tensions with Iran and Saudi Arabia, particularly over issues like the Kurdish question and the competition for energy resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe advancement of the 'Belt and Road' initiative in the Middle East faces multiple geopolitical risks, including the rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Turkey's regional rise, and the complex ethnic and religious conflicts within the region. These risks not only affect China's economic interests but can also lead to project delays and increased costs, requiring China to adopt more flexible and diverse strategies in its foreign and economic policies to address the evolving regional situation.\nThe diversity of political systems in the Middle East is influenced by history, religion, and external intervention. Political systems in different countries range from monarchies and republics to authoritarian regimes, reflecting complex internal and external factors. For example, the monarchy in Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic in Iran illustrate the different roles of tradition and religion in political systems.\n\nOne characteristic of political evolution in the Middle East is frequent coups and political instability, which significantly undermine political stability. For instance, the civil wars in Syria and Yemen have led to prolonged instability, while multiple coups in Egypt have further exacerbated political and social divisions.\n\nExternal intervention, particularly from major powers like the U.S. and Russia, has had a profound impact on political stability in the Middle East. These external forces, by supporting specific regimes, providing military aid, and engaging in geopolitical games, have heightened tensions in the region. For example, U.S. military operations in Iraq and Russian involvement in Syria have significantly influenced the political landscapes of these countries.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Political systems in Middle Eastern countries generally face the dual challenges of internal contradictions and external interference, leading to a persistent lack of political stability. For example, the civil war that erupted in Syria in 2011 was not only due to religious and ethnic divisions within the country but also to the intervention of external powers such as Iran, Russia, and the United States, further complicating the situation.\n\nMonarchical states, despite appearing more stable on the surface, have closed political systems and a lack of democratic participation mechanisms, which make it difficult for social discontent to be vented through legitimate channels, thus increasing potential political risks. For instance, Saudi Arabia maintains a superficial stability through high welfare and strict religious control, but its high youth unemployment rate and desire for democratic reforms could still lead to social unrest.\n\nHybrid regime countries often struggle to find effective governance models while trying to balance tradition with modernity and religion with secularism, leading to the fragility of their political systems. For example, Tunisia's democratic transition after the Arab Spring in 2011 has made some progress, but economic difficulties, terrorist threats, and political factionalism continue to severely constrain its political stability and sustainable development. Saudi Arabia has implemented a national branding strategy to promote economic diversification and the development of non-oil sectors, reducing its dependence on oil revenue. Specific measures include developing tourism, entertainment, and high-tech industries, as well as attracting foreign investment through large projects like the NEOM future city. These initiatives not only promote economic restructuring but also enhance Saudi Arabia's international image and appeal.\n\nEconomic diversification has a positive impact on political stability, particularly in reducing the resource curse effect. By developing non-oil sectors, Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia can reduce the risk of economic volatility and decrease their reliance on a single resource, thereby enhancing political and social stability. For example, Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 aims to diversify the economy, reduce unemployment, and improve living standards, which helps to alleviate social tensions.\n\nChina-Middle East cooperation plays a significant role in the economic diversification of Middle Eastern countries. Through technology transfer, investment, and trade cooperation, it accelerates the development of non-oil sectors. China's advanced technologies and experience in infrastructure construction, new energy, and the digital economy provide valuable resources and opportunities for Middle Eastern countries. For example, China's involvement in the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia has brought not only capital but also technology and management expertise, facilitating the smooth progress of the project.\nMiddle Eastern countries have significantly increased their investments in education and human resource development, but the results are uneven. For example, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have made significant progress in educational investment and quality, while countries like Yemen and Syria, due to ongoing conflicts and instability, have suffered severe damage to their education systems. This has led to significant disparities in human resource development, affecting the long-term political stability and economic potential of these countries.\n\nThe impact of education and human resource development on political stability in the Middle East is particularly complex. Higher education levels are generally associated with increased political participation, but this can also lead to dissatisfaction with the political system and demands for reform. For example, the younger generations in Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are better educated, have higher expectations for political and social change, which to some extent exacerbates political instability. At the same time, inequalities and quality differences in the education system exacerbate social inequality, further affecting political stability.\n\nTechnological advancements and digitization play a crucial role in education and human resource development in the Middle East. Many countries, such as the UAE and Israel, have integrated technology into their education systems, improving educational quality and efficiency. However, the uneven distribution of technology and the digital divide between different countries and regions still limit the comprehensive impact of technology on education and human resource development. Additionally, the application of technology brings new challenges, such as cybersecurity and data privacy issues, which require further attention from policymakers and educational institutions.\nMiddle Eastern countries' performance in providing social welfare and public services varies significantly, leading to notable differences in political stability. For example, Gulf Cooperation Council countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE invest heavily in education, healthcare, and housing, enhancing social cohesion and political support through high-welfare policies. In contrast, countries like Syria and Yemen, due to prolonged conflict and economic hardship, suffer from severe deficiencies in social welfare and public services, exacerbating social discontent and political unrest.\n\nThe provision of social welfare and public services not only directly affects people's quality of life but also impacts the mental health of urban residents during the urbanization process. Studies show that rapid urbanization leads to changes in social structures and family relationships, increasing individual psychological stress and social isolation. For example, Egypt and Jordan have urbanization rates of 43.2% and 83.7%, respectively, but mental health issues among urban residents are becoming increasingly serious, posing a significant threat to social stability.\n\nDifferences in the provision of social welfare and public services in Middle Eastern countries also manifest in support for women and young people. In some countries, such as Qatar and Kuwait, women's education and employment opportunities have significantly improved, enhancing their economic participation and social status. However, in others like Iran and Iraq, women and young people face higher unemployment rates and educational restrictions, which not only limit human resource development but also increase social discontent and political instability.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have shown significant promise with the development of CAR T-cell therapy, which involves genetically modifying a patient's T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. This approach has achieved remarkable success rates, particularly in treating hematological malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with complete response rates ranging from 40% to 90% in clinical trials.\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, have revolutionized the treatment of various solid tumors by blocking the immune system's inhibitory signals, thereby enhancing T-cell activation and tumor cell killing. Notable successes include the approval of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo) for melanoma, lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma, with response rates ranging from 20% to 40% in different patient populations.\n\nBispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) represent a novel class of immunotherapies that can redirect T cells to target cancer cells by simultaneously binding to a T-cell receptor and a tumor antigen. Blinatumomab, the first approved BiTE, has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating B-cell precursor ALL, with complete remission rates of up to 40% in clinical trials, and is being explored for other hematological malignancies and solid tumors.\nTraditional chemotherapy often fails to achieve complete remission due to the development of drug resistance, which can be intrinsic or acquired through genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, and alterations in drug transport and metabolism. This resistance can significantly reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy, leading to treatment failure and disease progression. \n\nThe severe side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy, such as myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, and peripheral neuropathy, can severely impact the quality of life and limit the dosage and duration of treatment. These side effects are often dose-limiting and can necessitate treatment interruptions or dose reductions, further compromising the therapeutic outcome.\n\nThe heterogeneity of cancer cells within a tumor and between different patients poses a significant challenge for traditional chemotherapy, as it can lead to the selection of resistant subpopulations and the failure to eliminate all cancer cells. This heterogeneity necessitates the development of more personalized and combination therapies to improve treatment outcomes.\nImmunotherapy has shown superior long-term survival rates compared to chemotherapy in several types of advanced cancers, such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, with a 5-year survival rate increase of up to 20% in some studies. This enhanced efficacy is attributed to the ability of immunotherapy to target cancer cells more selectively and sustain immune response over time.\n\nImmunotherapy generally has a more favorable safety profile compared to chemotherapy, with fewer and less severe side effects. Chemotherapy often leads to significant hematological toxicities, such as neutropenia and anemia, affecting up to 70% of patients, while immunotherapy is more commonly associated with immune-related adverse events, which can be managed with appropriate interventions like corticosteroids.\n\nPatient outcomes in terms of quality of life are often better with immunotherapy due to its lower toxicity and fewer treatment-related disruptions. Patients on immunotherapy report higher physical and emotional well-being, with fewer interruptions in daily activities and work, contributing to a more positive overall treatment experience.\nAdvancements in neoantigen-based vaccines are showing promise in personalized cancer immunotherapy, with clinical trials demonstrating the ability to elicit robust and specific immune responses against patient-specific mutations. These vaccines are being developed by companies like Moderna and BioNTech, leveraging mRNA technology to deliver neoantigens that can enhance T-cell activation and tumor recognition.\n\nThe use of bispecific antibodies, which can simultaneously bind to two different antigens, is emerging as a potent strategy to enhance the efficacy of T-cell engagement and tumor cell lysis. Companies such as Amgen and Genmab are at the forefront of this innovation, with several bispecific antibodies in clinical development, including those targeting CD3 and various tumor-associated antigens like CD19 and HER2.\n\nCAR-T cell therapy is expanding beyond hematological malignancies to solid tumors, with novel approaches to improve tumor infiltration and persistence. Recent studies have explored the use of armored CAR-T cells, which are engineered to secrete cytokines or other immune-stimulatory molecules to create a more favorable tumor microenvironment. This approach has shown promising results in preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials, particularly in targeting solid tumors like glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer.\nThe historical transition from chemotherapy to immunotherapy in cancer treatment highlights a shift from non-specific, highly toxic interventions to targeted, patient-specific therapies. Chemotherapy, introduced in the mid-20th century, initially involved the use of highly toxic agents like nitrogen mustard, which were derived from chemical warfare agents and caused significant side effects, including severe nausea, hair loss, and immunosuppression. Over the decades, advancements in chemotherapy have led to the development of combination therapies and dose-adjustment strategies that have improved patient tolerance and outcomes, but the fundamental limitations of non-specific targeting and systemic toxicity remained.\n\nThe advent of immunotherapy in the late 20th and early 21st centuries marked a paradigm shift in cancer treatment by leveraging the patient's own immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Key milestones include the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab, which was approved by the FDA in 2011 for the treatment of melanoma, and the development of CAR T-cell therapy, which involves genetically modifying a patient's T-cells to target specific cancer antigens. These advancements have shown significant promise in treating various cancers, including those that were previously resistant to conventional therapies, and have led to durable responses and improved survival rates in clinical trials.\n\nThe evolution from chemotherapy to immunotherapy also underscores the importance of personalized medicine and the integration of multiple therapeutic approaches. While immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, it is not universally effective for all patients or cancer types. Therefore, current research focuses on combinatorial strategies that integrate immunotherapy with chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and radiation to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance. This multidisciplinary approach aims to tailor treatment regimens to individual patient profiles, optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.</learnings>\n"

Immunotherapy can induce a memory response in the immune system, providing long-lasting protection and potential for durable remission, unlike chemotherapy, which often results in temporary remission due to its non-specific cytotoxic effects. The specificity of immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T-cell therapy, allows for targeted attacks on tumor-specific antigens, reducing collateral damage to healthy tissues and enhancing overall treatment efficacy in certain cases, particularly in cancers with high mutational burdens like melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.\nImmunotherapy demonstrates superior long-term survival rates compared to chemotherapy, particularly in advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, with a 5-year survival rate of 16% for immunotherapy versus 4% for chemotherapy.\n\nImmunotherapy is associated with a lower incidence of severe side effects compared to chemotherapy, with grade 3-4 adverse events occurring in approximately 10-15% of immunotherapy patients versus 60-80% of chemotherapy patients, leading to better quality of life and fewer treatment discontinuations.\n\nMeta-analyses of multiple randomized controlled trials indicate that while immunotherapy shows a significant survival benefit over chemotherapy in certain cancer types, the response rate is highly variable, with only 20-30% of patients achieving a durable response, suggesting the need for biomarker-guided patient selection to optimize outcomes.\nEmerging targets in cancer immunotherapy, such as TIGIT, LAG-3, and TIM-3, are showing promise in clinical trials, with early results indicating significant improvements in response rates and survival outcomes in various solid tumors and hematological malignancies.\n\nCombination therapies that integrate immune checkpoint inhibitors with other modalities, such as CAR T-cell therapy, oncolytic viruses, and radiation therapy, are demonstrating synergistic effects, leading to enhanced tumor control and prolonged patient survival, particularly in previously refractory cancers.\n\nPersonalized medicine approaches, including neoantigen-based vaccines and individualized adoptive T-cell transfer, are leveraging next-generation sequencing and advanced computational models to identify patient-specific tumor antigens, thereby enabling more precise and effective therapeutic interventions with reduced off-target effects.\nResistance mechanisms in cancer immunotherapy are multifaceted and can involve both intrinsic and adaptive pathways. Tumor cells can develop resistance by upregulating immune checkpoint molecules, altering antigen presentation, and creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. For example, the overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells can lead to the inhibition of T-cell activation, thereby evading immune surveillance.\n\nAdverse events associated with cancer immunotherapy, such as immune-related adverse events (irAEs), can significantly impact patient outcomes and treatment adherence. These events can affect various organs, including the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and endocrine system, and can range from mild to severe. The management of irAEs often requires the use of immunosuppressive agents, which can in turn affect the efficacy of the immunotherapy.\n\nPatient selection criteria for cancer immunotherapy are crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes and minimizing adverse effects. Factors such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and the presence of specific biomarkers (e.g., PD-L1 expression) are increasingly used to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. However, these biomarkers are not always predictive, and there is a need for more comprehensive and personalized approaches to patient selection.\nThe development of immunotherapy for cancer treatment was significantly advanced by the discovery of the T-cell receptor in 1983 by Mark Davis, which provided a foundational understanding of how T-cells recognize and bind to antigens, paving the way for future immunotherapeutic strategies.\n\nThe first successful use of chemotherapy in cancer treatment was achieved by Alfred Gilman and Louis Goodman in 1942, who demonstrated that nitrogen mustard, a chemical warfare agent, could treat lymphoma by inducing remission in a patient, marking a pivotal moment in the history of cancer chemotherapy.\n\nJames P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo independently discovered the immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA-4 and PD-1 in the 1990s, which led to the development of monoclonal antibodies such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, revolutionizing the treatment of advanced melanoma and other cancers by unlocking the patient's immune system to attack tumor cells.</learnings>\n"

Blocking this interaction with antibodies such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab can restore T cell function and enhance antitumor immunity.\n\nRegulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in suppressing antitumor immune responses by secreting immunosuppressive cytokines like TGF-β and IL-10, and by expressing high levels of inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, which can be targeted to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies.\nImmunotherapy has shown superior long-term clinical outcomes in specific cancer types, such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of 30-40% in melanoma patients compared to 10-20% with chemotherapy. This is attributed to the ability of immunotherapy to target cancer cells more precisely and sustain immune memory, reducing the risk of recurrence.\n\nPatient testimonials highlight the significant difference in quality of life between immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Patients undergoing immunotherapy report fewer and less severe side effects, such as fatigue and nausea, which are common and often debilitating in chemotherapy. This leads to better physical and emotional well-being during and after treatment.\n\nCase studies in renal cell carcinoma demonstrate that while both immunotherapy and chemotherapy can achieve initial tumor shrinkage, immunotherapy is more effective in maintaining long-term disease control. For instance, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018 showed that the median progression-free survival for patients on immunotherapy was 11.6 months, compared to 8.4 months for those on chemotherapy.\nEmerging strategies in cancer immunotherapy, such as the development of bispecific antibodies and CAR T-cell therapies, are showing promise in overcoming tumor heterogeneity and resistance, with several Phase II and III clinical trials demonstrating significant improvements in patient outcomes, including higher response rates and prolonged survival.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cancer immunotherapy is revolutionizing the identification of novel targets and the prediction of patient responses, with companies like Tempus and GNS Healthcare leading the way by leveraging large datasets and advanced computational models to personalize treatment plans.\n\nChallenges in cancer immunotherapy, including immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and the need for biomarkers to predict response, are driving the development of new monitoring and diagnostic tools, with recent studies highlighting the potential of liquid biopsies and single-cell sequencing to provide real-time insights into tumor evolution and immune dynamics.\nThe development of cancer chemotherapy was significantly advanced by the discovery of nitrogen mustard's cytotoxic properties during World War II, leading to the first successful use of alkylating agents in treating lymphoma in 1943. This breakthrough was primarily driven by the work of Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman, who demonstrated the therapeutic potential of these agents and laid the groundwork for the systematic development of chemotherapy as a cancer treatment modality.\n\nJames P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo independently discovered the immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA-4 and PD-1, respectively, in the 1990s, which revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. Allison's work on CTLA-4 led to the development of ipilimumab, the first checkpoint inhibitor to show a survival benefit in patients with advanced melanoma, while Honjo's research on PD-1 resulted in the development of nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which have shown significant efficacy in a variety of cancers, including lung and kidney cancer.\n\nThe seminal work of Carl June and his team at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 2010s on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy marked a new era in cancer immunotherapy. Their successful clinical trials using CAR T-cells to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and young adults, particularly the case of Emily Whitehead, demonstrated the potential of this approach to achieve high remission rates and long-term survival in patients with previously untreatable cancers.\nImmunotherapy and chemotherapy patient selection criteria differ significantly, with immunotherapy increasingly relying on biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI), while chemotherapy often focuses on tumor stage, histology, and performance status. The integration of multi-omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, is emerging as a critical strategy to refine patient selection and predict response to immunotherapy, enhancing the precision of treatment decisions. Future trends in biomarker development for immunotherapy are likely to involve the identification of novel biomarkers from the tumor microenvironment, such as specific immune cell subsets and cytokine profiles, which could provide more granular insights into patient response and guide combination therapies.</learnings>\n"

Additionally, adoptive cell transfer (ACT) techniques, such as CAR-T cell therapy, involve genetically modifying T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that target specific tumor antigens, leading to enhanced tumor-specific cytotoxicity.\n\nChemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cells, including both cancerous and normal cells, through various mechanisms such as DNA damage, microtubule disruption, and topoisomerase inhibition. Common chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin and doxorubicin induce DNA damage, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Microtubule inhibitors, such as paclitaxel, stabilize or destabilize microtubules, preventing proper mitotic spindle formation and causing mitotic arrest. Topoisomerase inhibitors, like etoposide, interfere with DNA replication and transcription by trapping topoisomerase-DNA complexes, resulting in DNA strand breaks and cell death.\n\nTargeting cytokine and chemokine signaling pathways can enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy by modulating the tumor microenvironment. Cytokines like IL-2 and IL-12 can stimulate immune cell activation and proliferation, while chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 can recruit immune cells to the tumor site. Inhibition of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-β and IL-10, can reduce the suppressive effects of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), thereby enhancing the overall antitumor immune response.\nLong-term clinical outcomes for patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma treated with immunotherapy, such as pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), show significantly higher five-year survival rates compared to chemotherapy. For example, in melanoma, the five-year survival rate for patients treated with pembrolizumab is approximately 38%, compared to 18% for those treated with chemotherapy.\n\nPatient testimonials highlight the improved quality of life with immunotherapy, particularly in terms of fewer and less severe side effects compared to chemotherapy. Patients often report experiencing less nausea, fatigue, and hair loss, which are common and often debilitating side effects of chemotherapy.\n\nIn non-small cell lung cancer, the use of pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment has shown a notable improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival, with a median overall survival of 22.3 months for pembrolizumab versus 10.5 months for chemotherapy.\nBispecific antibodies are demonstrating significant efficacy in enhancing the targeting and killing of cancer cells by simultaneously binding to two different antigens, one on the cancer cell and another on the T cell, thereby facilitating a more precise and potent immune response. This approach has shown promise in early clinical trials, with some bispecific antibodies achieving complete response rates of up to 60% in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies.\n\nCAR T-cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematological cancers, particularly in multiple myeloma, where it has achieved impressive response rates and durable remissions. The use of CAR T cells in multiple myeloma has led to complete response rates of over 50% in clinical trials, with some patients achieving long-term remissions lasting several years. However, challenges such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity remain significant hurdles that require further research and optimization.\n\nAI and machine learning (ML) applications are transforming the landscape of cancer immunotherapy by enabling more efficient and personalized treatment strategies. These technologies are being used to predict patient response to immunotherapies, identify novel biomarkers, and optimize the design of clinical trials. For instance, AI-driven platforms have been developed to analyze large genomic datasets and identify specific genetic mutations that correlate with better outcomes, thereby facilitating the selection of patients most likely to benefit from specific immunotherapies.\nImmune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a significant challenge in cancer immunotherapy, often leading to treatment discontinuation and requiring careful management. irAEs can affect multiple organ systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, lungs, and endocrine glands, and their incidence and severity can vary widely among patients. Strategies to mitigate irAEs include dose adjustments, corticosteroid therapy, and the use of biologics like infliximab, with emerging research focusing on predictive biomarkers to identify high-risk patients.\n\nBiomarker development in cancer immunotherapy is critical for optimizing patient selection and treatment response, but it remains a complex and evolving field. Key biomarkers include PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). However, these biomarkers have limitations, such as variable predictive value across different cancer types and the need for more standardized testing methods. Advanced genomic and proteomic technologies, along with machine learning algorithms, are being explored to identify novel biomarkers and improve the accuracy of response prediction.\n\nResistance mechanisms to cancer immunotherapy are multifaceted and can involve both intrinsic tumor properties and the tumor microenvironment. Tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion strategies, and the presence of immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to resistance. Strategies to overcome resistance include combination therapies with targeted agents, such as MEK inhibitors or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, and the use of oncolytic viruses to enhance tumor immunogenicity. Ongoing research is also investigating the role of the gut microbiome in modulating immune responses and its potential as a therapeutic target.\nThe discovery of cyclophosphamide in the 1950s by researchers at the Sloan Kettering Institute marked a significant milestone in the development of chemotherapy, leading to its widespread use in treating various cancers, particularly lymphomas and leukemias, and setting the stage for combination chemotherapy regimens that would become standard practice in the following decades.\n\nThe identification of the first cancer immunotherapy, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), by Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin in the early 20th century, demonstrated the potential of the immune system to combat cancer. BCG was initially developed as a tuberculosis vaccine but later found to be effective in treating superficial bladder cancer, highlighting the therapeutic potential of immunomodulatory agents.\n\nJames P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo independently discovered the immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA-4 and PD-1 in the 1990s, which revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. Their work led to the development of drugs like ipilimumab and nivolumab, which have significantly improved survival rates in patients with advanced melanoma and other solid tumors, paving the way for a new era of cancer treatment that harnesses the immune system's power.</learnings>\n"

These new targets are being explored in combination with existing checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1 and CTLA-4 to achieve synergistic effects and improve patient outcomes. \n\nAdvancements in CAR T-cell therapy have expanded beyond CD19 to include new targets like BCMA and GPC3, leading to significant clinical responses in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Novel CAR designs, including armored CARs and universal CARs, are being developed to enhance efficacy, reduce toxicity, and enable off-the-shelf treatments, thereby broadening the therapeutic window for patients. \n\nThe development of cancer vaccines, particularly neoantigen-based vaccines and mRNA vaccines, has gained momentum, with early clinical trials demonstrating the ability to elicit robust and specific immune responses against tumor antigens. These vaccines are being investigated in combination with other immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, to enhance their effectiveness and provide a more personalized approach to cancer treatment. \nEmerging gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, are poised to revolutionize cancer treatment by enabling precise modifications to the genome, potentially correcting genetic mutations that drive cancer development and enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies. \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being integrated into cancer diagnostics and treatment planning, leading to more accurate and personalized therapeutic strategies. AI-driven platforms can analyze vast datasets to identify novel biomarkers, predict patient outcomes, and optimize treatment regimens, reducing the trial-and-error approach in oncology. \n\nNanotechnology is advancing cancer therapy through the development of targeted drug delivery systems that can transport therapeutic agents directly to tumor sites, minimizing side effects and improving treatment efficacy. Nanoparticles can be engineered to release drugs in response to specific stimuli, such as changes in pH or temperature, ensuring that the drugs are active only in the tumor microenvironment. \nReal-world evidence from studies on pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrates that patient outcomes, including overall survival and progression-free survival, can vary significantly from those observed in clinical trials, often due to differences in patient populations and comorbidities. \n\nLong-term follow-up studies of chemo-immunotherapy combinations in various cancers, such as NSCLC and melanoma, reveal that while these regimens can lead to durable responses and improved survival, they are associated with higher rates of adverse events, which can impact patient quality of life and necessitate careful management. \n\nReal-world data from the introduction of chemo-immunotherapy in clinical practice highlight the importance of patient selection and personalized treatment approaches, as certain subgroups, such as those with specific genetic mutations or performance statuses, may derive greater benefit or experience more severe side effects, influencing overall outcomes and quality of life. \nImmunotherapy, particularly nivolumab, is shown to be more cost-effective than paclitaxel in certain cancer types, especially when considering long-term survival benefits and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Atezolizumab, another immunotherapy agent, demonstrates superior cost-effectiveness compared to traditional chemotherapy regimens in first-line treatments, primarily due to its higher response rates and prolonged progression-free survival. First-line immunotherapy combinations, such as those involving nivolumab and ipilimumab, are generally more cost-effective than chemotherapy alone, despite higher initial costs, due to their ability to significantly extend overall survival and reduce the need for subsequent treatments.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The historical progress view has been widely discussed in modern Western historical theory, especially during the Enlightenment of the 18th century, by figures such as Condorcet and Comte. They believed that history is a process of continuous development, and through scientific and technological advancements, human society will gradually reach a more perfect and rational state. This perspective emphasizes linear time and the positive role of human reason.\n\nThe concept of progress in philosophy is closely related to social change and cultural development. Tian Feng points out in 'Philosophy, Culture, and the Times' that cultural progress is not only reflected in material and technological aspects but also in the deeper levels of spiritual and value improvements. He believes that cultural progress is achieved through constant reflection and criticism of old cultural forms, forming new, more inclusive, and universal cultural systems, thus promoting overall social development.\n\nThe progress view in sociology focuses on the evolution of social structures and functions, emphasizing that social progress is not just about improving material conditions but also includes the optimization of social institutions, organizational forms, and interpersonal relationships. Sociologists like Durkheim and Weber argue that the key to social progress lies in the degree of social integration and rationalization. Through the rationalization of social organizations and the standardization of individual behaviors, overall social progress can be achieved. Economic indicators for measuring the progress of human civilization typically include GDP growth rate, per capita GDP, employment rate, and income distribution. These indicators reflect the health of economic activities and the improvement of people's living standards. For example, China's GDP growth rate reached 6.1% in 2022, with per capita GDP exceeding $12,000, indicating sustained economic growth and significant improvements in people's living standards.\n\nThe level of technological development is an important dimension for measuring the progress of human civilization, covering technological innovation, R&D investment, patent numbers, and technology transfer rates. The Chinese Academy of Sciences journal notes that China's R&D investment has significantly increased over the past decade, reaching 2.79 trillion yuan in 2021, accounting for 2.44% of GDP. Additionally, China has made significant breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and quantum information, which have rapidly developed and provided strong impetus for civilizational progress.\n\nDevelopment in social and cultural aspects is equally important, including education levels, health status, social inclusiveness, and cultural diversity. Research on the world modernization index system indicates that education and health are the cornerstones of social development. China's nine-year compulsory education普及 rate has reached 99.9%, and life expectancy has increased from 74.8 years in 2010 to 77.3 years in 2020. At the same time, social inclusiveness indicators such as gender equality and the improvement of social safety nets show positive trends, contributing to social harmony and stability. Subjectivity plays a crucial role in measuring civilizational progress because it involves personal and societal values, beliefs, and emotions. For example, when measuring the value of life, it is necessary to consider not only material contributions to society but also personal morals, emotions, and social relationships. These subjective factors hold significant importance in the assessment of civilizational progress.\n\nObjectivity is also indispensable in measuring civilizational progress, as it provides quantifiable standards and data, ensuring the scientific and fair nature of the assessment. For instance, in the study of the historical form of Chinese-style modernization, objective data and historical facts can more accurately evaluate the specific achievements and impacts of civilizational progress.\n\nThe combination of subjectivity and objectivity can more comprehensively reflect the complexity and multidimensionality of civilizational progress. Research on the intrinsic logic and essential characteristics of modern Chinese civilization shows that civilizational progress requires not only objective economic development indicators but also considerations of cultural inheritance and social harmony. The combination of both can more accurately assess the comprehensive development level of civilization.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The provided contents do not directly address the specific views of philosophers Condorcet, Comte, and Tian Feng on the concept of 'progress.' However, based on general knowledge and the context of the query, here are three distinct key learnings:\n\nCondorcet viewed progress as an inevitable and continuous movement toward human perfection, driven by the accumulation of knowledge and the advancement of education. He believed that through the spread of enlightenment and the improvement of societal institutions, humanity would achieve greater equality and freedom.\n\nComte's concept of progress was rooted in his positivist philosophy, which emphasized the scientific method and the systematic observation of social phenomena. He proposed a three-stage model of societal development: theological, metaphysical, and positive (scientific). Comte argued that progress would be realized through the application of scientific principles to social organization, leading to a more rational and harmonious society.\n\nTian Feng, a contemporary Chinese philosopher, has contributed to the discourse on progress by integrating traditional Chinese thought with modern socio-political theories. He posits that progress should be understood as a holistic development that balances material prosperity with moral and spiritual advancement. Tian Feng advocates for a model of progress that emphasizes sustainable development and social equity, drawing on Confucian values of harmony and collective well-being.\nDurkheim and Weber provided different perspectives on the specific indicators and theoretical frameworks of social progress. Durkheim emphasized the importance of social solidarity and integration, arguing that the enhancement of social solidarity is a key indicator of social progress. He introduced the concepts of mechanical solidarity and organic solidarity, where mechanical solidarity exists in traditional societies, and organic solidarity is more prevalent in modern societies, achieved through division of labor and cooperation.\n\nWeber explored social progress from the angles of rationalization and bureaucracy. He believed that the progress of modern society is reflected in the deepening of the rationalization process, including the distinction between instrumental rationality and value rationality. The establishment and popularization of bureaucracy is a significant manifestation of rationalization, enabling society to function more orderly through efficient management.\n\nAlthough the two sociologists had different theoretical frameworks, they both focused on the interaction between social structure and individual behavior. Durkheim placed more emphasis on the impact of social structure on individual behavior, while Weber stressed the role of individual behavior in shaping social structure. These theoretical frameworks provide multi-dimensional perspectives for understanding social progress, helping to deeply analyze the mechanisms of social change.\nA new perspective on measuring the progress of civilization: risk. Economist Chen Zhiwu proposed in an interview with Sohu that risk is an important measure of the development of civilization. This view emphasizes the core role of risk management in social, economic, and technological development, suggesting that the maturity of a civilization can be measured by how it deals with and manages risks. For example, the maturity of financial markets, the completeness of insurance systems, and the risk-taking capacity of technological innovation are all key indicators of the progress of civilization.\n\nThe importance of cultural diversity and cultural autonomy. Chao Gejin discussed the relationship between cultural diversity and cultural autonomy in the '2004 Human Development Report.' The report points out that cultural diversity is an important marker of the progress of civilization, and cultural autonomy is a crucial mechanism for ensuring cultural diversity. Specific cases include the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, which aims to protect and develop cultural expressions in different countries and regions, ensuring that cultural diversity is not eroded by globalization and economic integration.\n\nThe implementation and progress of the China Women's Development Program. The State Council's 'China Women's Development Program' details specific measures and goals for promoting women's rights and equality. The program covers multiple areas such as education, employment, health, and social security, using specific indicators and data to measure the progress of women's development. For example, the proportion of women receiving higher education, the participation rate of women in the labor market, and improvements in women's health status are all important aspects of measuring the progress of social civilization.\nThere is still room for improvement in the quantitative assessment of legal development, as pointed out by the Supreme People's Procuratorate. Existing evaluation methods lack sufficient integration of objectivity and subjectivity, requiring a more scientific and comprehensive evaluation system to reflect the multi-dimensional characteristics of legal development. This includes, but is not limited to, the diversity of data collection, transparency of evaluation standards, and the effectiveness of applying evaluation results.\n\nIn the specific application of discipline construction level evaluation and effectiveness evaluation, it is necessary to balance subjectivity and objectivity. Discipline construction evaluation relies not only on objective data such as the number of published papers and citation rates but also on subjective evaluation methods such as expert reviews and peer reviews to comprehensively reflect the overall development level and actual effectiveness of the discipline.\n\nLiterature network analysis of ecological civilization research shows that subjectivity and objectivity are equally important in the evaluation of ecological civilization. Objective data such as environmental quality indicators and resource utilization efficiency provide a quantitative foundation, while subjective evaluations such as public satisfaction and policy awareness reflect the perception and feedback of society on the construction of ecological civilization. Combining both can more comprehensively assess the progress and effectiveness of ecological civilization.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Condorcet proposed ten stages of human progress in 'An Outline of the Historical Progress of the Human Mind,' emphasizing that science and reason are key forces driving social progress. He stressed the importance of education and the dissemination of knowledge in improving the overall level of society, believing that education can eliminate ignorance and superstition, promoting moral and political progress.\n\nComte introduced positivist philosophy in 'Course on Positive Philosophy,' arguing that human society has gone through theological, metaphysical, and positive stages, ultimately entering a scientific and rational society. He believed that the key to social progress lies in the application of scientific methods, solving social problems through scientific observation and experimentation to achieve social harmony and stability.\n\nTian Feng explored issues of progress in China's modernization process in 'Modernization and Progress of Chinese Society,' emphasizing the role of economic development and technological progress in driving social change. He pointed out that China's progress requires maintaining traditional culture while drawing on advanced Western technology and management experience to achieve comprehensive social development.\nDurkheim's 'Sociology of Suicide' delved into the impact of social integration and norms on individual behavior, particularly suicide. He identified four main types of suicide: egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic, each reflecting specific relationships between social structure and individual psychology.\n\nWeber's theory of social progress emphasized the role of rationalization and rationality in modern society, arguing that the development of modern society is driven by the interaction of instrumental rationality (Zweckrationalität) and value rationality (Wert-rationalität). Weber believed that the process of rationalization leads to the rigidification of social structures and the restriction of individual freedom, which resonates with Durkheim's theory of anomie to some extent.\n\nBoth Durkheim and Weber focused on the relationship between social integration and individual behavior, but their theoretical frameworks and emphases differed. Durkheim placed more emphasis on the normative role of social norms and collective consciousness on individual behavior, while Weber focused more on the rationalization and meaning construction of individual actions, believing that the rationalization process in modern society has profound impacts on individual freedom and meaning.\nChina's 16 typical regional economic development models show a trend of convergent evolution, exhibiting similar characteristics and paths in different regions and time periods, such as industrialization, urbanization, and innovation-driven growth, reflecting the unity and diversity of China's economic restructuring and transformation.\n\nThe white paper 'China's International Development Cooperation in the New Era' highlights China's role and contributions in international development cooperation, supporting other countries' economic development through aid, investment, and trade, particularly in poverty reduction, infrastructure construction, and technology transfer, demonstrating China's active role in global governance.\n\nThe advancement of China's path to human rights development has made significant progress in domestic human rights protection, such as improving education, healthcare, and social security, and has played an active role in international human rights efforts, participating in international human rights dialogue and cooperation to promote fairness and inclusiveness in global human rights governance.\nEvaluating the level of discipline construction not only requires quantitative indicators but also subjective assessments, such as expert reviews and peer evaluations, to comprehensively reflect the overall development status of the discipline. For example, the China Rule of Law Government Assessment Report (2021-2022) evaluated the level of rule of law development by using both objective data, such as the number of laws and regulations issued and the number of law enforcement cases, and expert subjective evaluations to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the assessment results.\n\nIn the evaluation of rule of law development, combining subjectivity and objectivity can more accurately reflect the actual effectiveness of rule of law construction. Through subjective assessments, deeper issues that data cannot easily capture, such as judicial fairness and government transparency, can be identified. For example, the China Rule of Law Government Assessment Report (2021-2022) provided important supplements to the assessment of the rule of law level through expert reviews and public satisfaction surveys, revealing potential problems and areas for improvement in rule of law construction.\n\nImproving the evaluation of discipline construction levels involves strengthening multi-dimensional assessments, including academic achievements, talent cultivation, social services, and international influence. For example, the China Rule of Law Government Assessment Report (2021-2022) proposed increasing the emphasis on rule of law education and talent cultivation in rule of law assessments to enhance the long-term sustainability of rule of law construction.</learnings>\n"

This early period was characterized by short, experimental films that often incorporated traditional Japanese art forms and storytelling techniques, laying the groundwork for the distinctive aesthetic and thematic elements that would become hallmarks of the genre.\n\nThe post-World War II era saw a significant transformation in the anime industry, driven by the rise of television and the establishment of influential studios such as Toei Animation and Mushi Production. Osamu Tezuka, often referred to as the 'God of Manga,' played a pivotal role in this evolution with his groundbreaking series 'Astro Boy' (1963), which introduced a more dynamic and expressive style of animation and storytelling. This period also saw the development of new business models, such as the use of tie-in products and international distribution, which helped to sustain and expand the industry.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s witnessed a global expansion of anime, with the international success of series like 'Akira' (1988) and 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' (1995), which garnered critical acclaim and a dedicated international fan base. This era was characterized by increased production values, more complex narratives, and a broader range of genres, from mecha and fantasy to psychological and philosophical themes. The global reach of anime during this period also led to the establishment of dedicated anime conventions and the growth of fan communities, further solidifying its status as a global cultural phenomenon.\nJapanese anime has significantly influenced global animation trends, evident in the adoption of its visual styles, storytelling techniques, and thematic elements by international animators and studios. This cultural crossover has led to a rise in co-productions and international collaborations, such as the partnership between Netflix and Studio Trigger, which have helped to further disseminate anime aesthetics and narratives worldwide.\n\nThe global popularity of Japanese anime has been bolstered by its accessibility through digital platforms, with streaming services like Crunchyroll and Netflix playing a crucial role in distributing content to a broader audience. As of 2021, Crunchyroll reported over 5 million subscribers, highlighting the substantial international demand for anime content.\n\nJapanese anime's cultural impact extends beyond entertainment, influencing fashion, music, and even language. Anime conventions and fan communities have become global phenomena, with events like Anime Expo in Los Angeles and Japan Expo in Paris attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees annually, underscoring the deep engagement and passion of the global anime fanbase.\nThe integration of Japanese anime storytelling techniques in Western media has led to a significant evolution in narrative structures, character development, and visual styles, as seen in the increasing popularity of anime-influenced series and films. Japanese anime often employs a cyclical narrative structure, where themes of rebirth and continuity are prevalent, reflecting deeper cultural values and philosophical perspectives that differ from linear Western storytelling. The use of specific visual motifs, such as the oversized eyes and exaggerated expressions, not only enhances emotional resonance but also serves as a means to convey complex emotions and character traits in a universally accessible manner.\nJapanese studios are increasingly integrating AI into their animation production processes, enhancing efficiency and creativity. For instance, Incredimate Studio has adopted AI for tasks such as automatic in-betweening and colorization, significantly reducing the time and resources required for these labor-intensive tasks. This shift allows animators to focus more on storytelling and character development, ultimately improving the quality of the final product.\n\nThe evolution of digital tools has revolutionized traditional animation techniques in Japan, with many studios transitioning from hand-drawn methods to digital workflows. This shift is exemplified by the widespread adoption of software like Toon Boom Harmony and Adobe Animate, which offer advanced features for animation, compositing, and post-production. These tools have streamlined the production pipeline, enabling faster turnaround times and more complex visual effects.\n\nJapanese animation has seen the emergence of new collaborative platforms and workflows that facilitate international co-productions and remote work. Studios are leveraging cloud-based solutions and virtual collaboration tools to work with talent from around the world, breaking down geographical barriers and expanding creative possibilities. This global collaboration has led to a more diverse and innovative animation landscape, with projects that blend different cultural influences and artistic styles.\nThe global popularity of Japanese anime has driven the industry to explore innovative distribution and marketing strategies, such as leveraging digital platforms and streaming services to reach a broader international audience, which has led to a significant increase in viewership and revenue. \n\nAnime advertising is evolving with the integration of advanced technologies like AI and data analytics, enabling more targeted and personalized ad placements that enhance viewer engagement and brand loyalty, as demonstrated by platforms like Twibi, which offer sophisticated ad solutions tailored to the unique audience demographics of anime fans. \n\nThe international success of Japanese anime has prompted the industry to focus on localization efforts, including dubbing, subtitling, and cultural adaptation, to better resonate with diverse global markets, ensuring that the content remains accessible and appealing across different regions and languages.</learnings>\n"

Streaming services like Crunchyroll and Netflix have played a crucial role in the global expansion of anime by investing in licensing, dubbing, and original productions, thereby reaching a broader audience and fostering a more inclusive fan community. The viral nature of social media platforms, such as Twitter and TikTok, has amplified the reach of anime through user-generated content, memes, and fan communities, which drive sustained interest and cultural relevance across multiple demographics and regions.\nGovernment support and cultural policies have been pivotal in the growth of the anime industry by fostering a robust ecosystem of talent development, production, and international promotion. For instance, the Japanese government's Cool Japan initiative, launched in 2010, aimed to boost the country's cultural exports, including anime, by providing financial support, tax incentives, and international marketing. This initiative has led to significant increases in the number of anime productions and the global reach of Japanese content.\n\nCultural policies that encourage the preservation and promotion of traditional Japanese aesthetics and storytelling techniques have played a crucial role in maintaining the unique appeal of anime. These policies have helped to preserve the distinct visual and narrative styles that set anime apart from other forms of animation, contributing to its global popularity and cultural impact.

These deals leverage the strengths of each partner, such as local market expertise and global distribution networks, to maximize the commercial and cultural impact of anime, thereby setting a precedent for sustainable and mutually beneficial international partnerships in the industry.</learnings>\n"

Crunchyroll and Aniplex have formed a strategic partnership to co-produce an epic anime, leveraging their combined resources and expertise in content creation, distribution, and global audience reach. This collaboration highlights the potential for international partnerships to enhance the quality and scale of anime productions, while also expanding their international market presence and fan base.\nThe Cool Japan initiative, launched by the Japanese government in the early 2000s, significantly boosted the international visibility and economic impact of the anime industry. By 2016, the initiative had helped the anime industry achieve a global market value of approximately $20 billion, a substantial increase from the early 2000s. The government's strategic promotion of anime through cultural exchange programs, international exhibitions, and financial support for production and distribution played a crucial role in this growth.\n\nThe Cool Japan initiative facilitated the establishment of partnerships between Japanese anime producers and international media companies, leading to a more diverse and expansive distribution network. For example, collaborations with streaming platforms like Netflix and Crunchyroll have enabled Japanese anime to reach a broader global audience, resulting in a 40% increase in international viewership between 2015 and 2020. These partnerships have also provided Japanese studios with additional revenue streams and creative opportunities, enhancing their sustainability and innovation.\n\nThe initiative's emphasis on fostering a vibrant and supportive ecosystem for the anime industry has led to the emergence of new talent and innovative content. Government-sponsored programs, such as the Content Japan Fund, have provided financial support and mentorship to emerging creators, contributing to a surge in the production of niche and experimental anime. This has not only enriched the cultural landscape but also helped Japan maintain its competitive edge in the global market, attracting international attention and investment.\nAI-driven tools have significantly streamlined the animation production pipeline, reducing manual labor and increasing efficiency. For instance, machine learning algorithms can automate tasks such as in-betweening, where the software generates the intermediate frames between keyframes, significantly cutting down the time and effort required for animators. This automation not only speeds up the production process but also allows for more complex and detailed animations without a proportional increase in production costs.\n\nThe integration of AI in animation has opened new avenues for creativity and personalization. AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data to generate unique character designs, environments, and storylines that cater to specific audiences. For example, Netflix has explored the use of AI to create personalized animated content that adapts to viewer preferences, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. This approach leverages AI's ability to process and interpret large datasets, leading to more tailored and engaging animated experiences.\n\nDigital distribution platforms have revolutionized the way animated content reaches audiences, bypassing traditional gatekeepers and enabling more diverse and independent creators to share their work. Streaming services like Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+ have democratized the distribution of animation, allowing for a broader range of content and styles to be produced and consumed. This shift has also empowered creators to reach global audiences directly, reducing the barriers to entry and fostering a more vibrant and diverse animation ecosystem.\nThe anime industry faces significant financial losses due to piracy, with estimates suggesting that illegal streaming sites are responsible for over $300 million in annual revenue loss, impacting the sustainability of production and distribution models. The global pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, leading to production delays and reduced theatrical releases, which traditionally serve as a crucial revenue stream for anime studios. The industry has responded by increasing legal action against piracy websites and collaborating with streaming platforms to offer more accessible and affordable content, but these efforts have had mixed results, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and innovative anti-piracy strategies.</learnings>\n"

Programs such as the 'Support Creators' campaign, launched by major anime companies, have successfully engaged fans and reduced piracy by 15% through a combination of community outreach, content accessibility improvements, and the promotion of legal streaming services.\nThe global pandemic significantly disrupted the production schedules of anime, leading to widespread delays and cancellations, with major studios like Toei Animation and Kyoto Animation experiencing production slowdowns that affected popular series such as 'One Piece' and 'Kaguya-sama: Love is War.' \n\nThe distribution of anime content shifted heavily towards digital platforms, accelerating the growth of streaming services like Crunchyroll and Netflix, which reported a surge in subscribers and viewership, with Crunchyroll alone seeing a 40% increase in its user base during the first year of the pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic also led to a reevaluation of the traditional anime production model, prompting the adoption of remote work and digital collaboration tools, which have since become more prevalent and are expected to continue even post-pandemic, potentially leading to more diverse and international collaborations in the industry.\nAdvancements in real-time rendering technologies, such as those powered by Unreal Engine and Unity, are significantly reducing production times and costs for anime studios, enabling more complex and detailed visual effects while maintaining high-quality standards. This shift is democratizing the production process, allowing smaller studios to compete with larger ones and fostering a more diverse range of creative projects.\n\nThe integration of AI and machine learning in the anime industry is revolutionizing character animation and background generation, automating labor-intensive tasks such as lip-syncing and motion capture. Companies like Adobe and Nvidia are leading the charge with tools that can generate highly realistic animations with minimal human intervention, potentially reducing the barrier to entry for new animators and studios.\n\nVirtual production techniques, including the use of LED volume stages and virtual cameras, are transforming the way anime is filmed and directed. These technologies allow for real-time visualization of virtual environments, enabling directors to make immediate adjustments and enhancing the creative process. This approach is being adopted by major studios like Studio Ghibli and Toei Animation, leading to more immersive and dynamic storytelling.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has become an important platform for regional political and economic cooperation since its establishment in 1967, with member states including Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. ASEAN established its status as a subject of international law through the ASEAN Charter, aiming to promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.\n\nThe economic growth in Southeast Asia has shown strong momentum in recent years, particularly in countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Vietnam's GDP growth rate reached 7.02% in 2022, making it one of the fastest-growing economies globally. The Philippines maintained an economic growth rate above 6%, primarily driven by the rapid development of the service and manufacturing sectors. As the largest economy in the region, Indonesia's GDP reached $1.2 trillion in 2022, growing by 5.3% year-on-year.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries exhibit diverse political characteristics, ranging from stable democracies like Singapore and the Philippines to military regimes like Myanmar. In recent years, Myanmar's political situation has been particularly volatile, with the February 2021 military coup leading to widespread international sanctions and social unrest, severely impacting the country's economic development and international image. In contrast, Singapore's political stability and rule of law have attracted substantial foreign investment, making it a financial and technology hub in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe formation of the European Union (EU) began with the Treaty of Paris in 1951, which established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), marking the beginning of European integration. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 further expanded the scope of cooperation, establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), laying the foundation for the modern EU.\n\nOne of the EU's distinctive features is its unique supranational institutional system, including the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, the European Commission, and the Court of Justice of the EU. These institutions play different roles and wield different powers in the decision-making process, ensuring that policies are both democratic and efficient.\n\nEU member states have gradually deepened economic and political integration through a series of treaties and agreements, including the Single European Act in 1986, the Maastricht Treaty (officially known as the Treaty on European Union) in 1992, the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997, and the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. These treaties not only strengthened cooperation among member states but also promoted the establishment and expansion of the Eurozone and the formation of a common foreign and security policy.\n\nThe cultural diversity of Southeast Asia is rooted in its complex ethnic structure, with significant differences among various ethnic groups in terms of language, religion, customs, and traditions. This diversity has been reinforced over historical processes, forming unique cultural landscapes. For example, different ethnic groups such as Malays, Indonesians, Khmers, Vietnamese, and Filipinos have formed distinct cultural identities in their respective countries and regions, playing key roles in the construction of national identity.\n\nThe historical process of Southeast Asia has been deeply influenced by external forces, especially colonialism and geopolitical rivalries during the Cold War. Colonial powers such as the Netherlands, Britain, France, and the United States ruled and intervened in Southeast Asian countries at different times. These external forces not only reshaped the region's political map but also profoundly impacted local culture and social structures. For instance, Vietnam's anti-French and anti-American struggles, and Indonesia's anti-colonial movements, were significant events under this historical backdrop.\n\nThe modernization process in Southeast Asia varies significantly across different countries and regions, reflecting differences not only in economic development levels but also in social structures and cultural changes. Countries like Singapore and Malaysia have achieved notable success in economic development and urbanization, while countries like Myanmar and Laos face more challenges in the modernization process. This difference reflects the complexity and diversity of the historical, political, economic, and cultural backgrounds of different countries.\n\nASEAN countries have demonstrated strong resilience in the face of geopolitical and economic challenges, strengthening regional economic cooperation and integration to mitigate external shocks, such as deepening trade and investment relations through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). However, internal development imbalances and political divisions remain major obstacles, particularly in politically unstable countries like Myanmar and Thailand, affecting the progress of regional cooperation.\n\nASEAN member states have shown significant potential for rapid growth in the digital economy and technological innovation, attracting substantial foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam. These countries have promoted the development of the digital economy by building innovation ecosystems and improving the business environment, but they also face challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and talent shortages.\n\nASEAN has taken proactive measures to address climate change and environmental protection, such as the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Environmentally Sustainable Development and the ASEAN Framework on Climate Change Adaptation. Despite these efforts, there are significant differences in environmental policies and enforcement among member states, leading to limited overall effectiveness, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where deforestation and pollution remain serious issues.\n\nThe paths to sustainable development goals differ significantly between the EU and ASEAN. The EU promotes sustainable development among member states through a multi-level governance structure and strict standards, while ASEAN adopts a more flexible and voluntary mechanism, emphasizing the sovereignty and autonomy of member states. This difference reflects fundamental distinctions in the governance models and policy implementation of the two regional organizations.\n\nThe EU's strategy in the Asia-Pacific region focuses not only on economic cooperation but also on security and defense cooperation. The National Defense Magazine notes that the EU enhances regional security cooperation by strengthening defense dialogues and joint exercises with Asia-Pacific countries, indicating that the EU's strategy in the region is comprehensive, aiming to deepen ties with the region in multiple areas.\n\nChina's role in promoting East Asian cooperation cannot be overlooked. Research by Song Wei et al. points out that China seeks to play a leadership role in East Asian cooperation through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative. However, China's strategy also faces challenges, such as balancing the interests of member states and resolving geopolitical conflicts within the region.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The political instability in Myanmar and Thailand has increased the internal instability of ASEAN, affecting the efficiency and depth of regional cooperation. The neutral stance of ASEAN has played a significant role in maintaining regional peace and stability, but it also limits its ability to take action on specific issues. Thailand's policy towards Myanmar reflects the complexity and caution of major regional powers when dealing with neighboring crises, highlighting the diversity and strategic differences within ASEAN in responding to political instability.\n\nThe ethnic diversity in Southeast Asian countries leads to complex inter-state relations, which to some extent affect the process of regional integration. For example, the Rakhine State issue in Myanmar not only involves domestic ethnic conflicts but also affects the relationship between Bangladesh and India, thereby impacting the stability and cooperation of the entire region.\n\nThe cultural and historical differences among Southeast Asian countries pose multiple challenges to regional integration efforts. Countries have different views on the priorities and goals of regional cooperation, such as the differences in economic integration stances between Singapore and Malaysia, and the divergences in the South China Sea issue between the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which hinder the advancement of regional integration.\n\nThe diversity in religion and language further complicates the process of regional integration in Southeast Asia. For instance, although Indonesia and Malaysia are both Islamic countries, they have significant differences in religious practices and language use, which influence their interactions at the political and cultural levels, and in turn affect the unified actions of the entire region.\n\nThere is a significant imbalance in economic development among ASEAN member states, especially in poverty reduction cooperation, where progress varies greatly among countries. For example, the poverty rates in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar remain high, while Singapore and Brunei have achieved significant success in poverty reduction, highlighting the substantial differences in development levels within the region.\n\nThe economic imbalance in ASEAN poses a challenge to the advancement of regional cooperation, particularly in formulating and implementing common policies. This imbalance leads to significant differences in interests and priorities among member states in areas such as trade, investment, and infrastructure development, thus affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of regional cooperation.\n\nDespite the economic imbalance, ASEAN promotes cooperation and coordinated development among member states through various mechanisms and initiatives, such as the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). These mechanisms aim to enhance infrastructure connectivity, improve trade facilitation, and promote regional economic integration, thereby narrowing the economic gap among member states.\n\nThe colonial history has profoundly influenced the regional cooperation model in Southeast Asia, leading countries to place greater emphasis on sovereignty and non-interference principles. For example, the establishment of ASEAN and the proposal of the non-interference principle were largely aimed at avoiding external intervention and internal instability caused by historical colonial rule. This historical context makes Southeast Asian countries more focused on maintaining national sovereignty and autonomy in internal affairs during regional cooperation.\n\nExternal intervention is cautiously handled in Southeast Asian regional cooperation, with countries tending to adopt a collective stance when facing external forces. ASEAN countries often maintain common interests through collective consultations and consistent actions when dealing with external pressures, which is particularly evident in handling relations with major powers. For example, despite internal differences, ASEAN generally remains vigilant against external intervention in handling the South China Sea disputes, emphasizing problem-solving through internal consultations and dialogue.\n\nThe regional cooperation in Southeast Asian countries is influenced by historical and cultural factors in norm-building, forming a unique cooperation model. This model not only emphasizes economic cooperation but also focuses on cultural and political integration. For example, while promoting economic integration, ASEAN also strengthens mutual understanding and trust among member states through various cultural exchange activities and political dialogue mechanisms. This multi-dimensional cooperation model helps enhance cohesion and stability within the region.\n\nThe main differences in governance models between ASEAN and the EU lie in the degree of institutionalization and decision-making mechanisms. ASEAN adopts a consensus-based decision-making mechanism, emphasizing equality and respect for sovereignty among member states, which results in a slower decision-making process and difficulty in reaching agreements. In contrast, the EU's decision-making mechanism is more centralized and institutionalized, with policies implemented through majority voting and supranational institutions such as the European Commission, European Parliament, and European Court of Justice, making the EU more efficient and unified in policy execution.\n\nIn terms of policy implementation, ASEAN's flexibility and non-binding nature are evident, giving member states considerable autonomy in adhering to regional agreements and policies, which to some extent weakens the effect of regional integration. The EU, on the other hand, ensures compliance with common policies through laws and regulatory documents, with violators potentially facing legal sanctions or economic penalties, ensuring the enforceability and consistency of policies.\n\nASEAN's institutional development is relatively lagging, primarily relying on informal consultation and dialogue mechanisms, lacking strong enforcement and supervision mechanisms. The EU, however, has a well-established institutional framework and enforcement agencies, such as the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors, which play key roles in maintaining economic stability and policy enforcement.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The 2021 military coup in Myanmar has exacerbated divisions within ASEAN, particularly on how to address the Myanmar crisis. ASEAN member states such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines advocate for more proactive intervention measures, while Thailand and Vietnam tend to maintain neutrality or support the Myanmar military government. This division has weakened ASEAN's unity and decision-making capabilities.\n\nThe diplomatic deadlock following the Myanmar coup highlights the institutional shortcomings of ASEAN in handling internal crises. Although ASEAN proposed the 'Five-Point Consensus' to resolve the Myanmar crisis, the lack of effective enforcement mechanisms and monitoring tools has led to its ineffective implementation, further exposing ASEAN's inadequacies in crisis management.\n\nThe Myanmar coup has had a negative impact on ASEAN's international image, with the international community criticizing ASEAN's ineffectiveness and inaction in dealing with the Myanmar crisis. This not only damages ASEAN's credibility as an effective regional organization but may also affect its leadership role in other regional cooperation and security matters.\nSignificant cultural and historical differences among Southeast Asian countries have greatly influenced the process of regional integration. For example, Muslim-majority countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei have significant religious and social customs differences compared to Buddhist-majority countries like Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos. This cultural diversity poses challenges in formulating unified regional policies.\n\nHistorical differences cannot be overlooked either. For instance, Vietnam and Cambodia were long under French colonial rule, while the Philippines was influenced by American colonialism. These different colonial histories have led to significant differences in political systems, legal frameworks, and economic development models, resulting in varying interests and strategic goals in regional cooperation.\n\nEfforts towards regional integration must fully consider these cultural and historical differences to promote more effective cooperation. For example, ASEAN (ASEAN) adopts a flexible and gradual approach in promoting regional integration, allowing member states to gradually participate and adapt according to their own circumstances. This has, to some extent, mitigated the obstacles posed by cultural and historical differences.\nCambodia, Laos, and Myanmar have higher poverty rates, which significantly affect ASEAN's economic cooperation and integration process. According to reports from 'The Status of Poverty Reduction Cooperation in ASEAN' and 'Research on the Progress of Poverty Reduction Issues in ASEAN Countries', the poverty rates in these countries in 2019 were 17.8%, 22.2%, and 15.2%, respectively. Poverty not only limits the internal economic development of these countries but also affects trade and investment flows within the region, leading to underutilized economic potential in ASEAN as a whole.\n\nPoverty distribution in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar is uneven, with rural areas having much higher poverty rates than urban areas. According to research in 'China-ASEAN Relations in the Context of Inclusive Development', the poverty rates in rural areas are 2.5 times, 3.0 times, and 2.0 times those in urban areas, respectively. This urban-rural disparity exacerbates social inequality, impacts social stability and sustainable economic development, and poses challenges to ASEAN's regional cooperation.\n\nChina has played a significant role in ASEAN's poverty reduction efforts, providing technical assistance, financial support, and project cooperation to help countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar improve their poverty conditions. According to reports from 'The Status of Poverty Reduction Cooperation in ASEAN' and 'China International Poverty Reduction Center', China provided over $1 billion in aid and implemented multiple poverty reduction projects, including infrastructure construction, agricultural technology promotion, and education and healthcare support, between 2015 and 2020. These cooperative projects have not only enhanced poverty reduction outcomes in these countries but also strengthened economic ties between China and ASEAN, promoting regional economic integration.\nU.S. strategy in Southeast Asia is influenced by its strategic competition with China, leading to multiple obstacles in its implementation. U.S. strategy often focuses too much on containing China, neglecting the diverse needs and interests of Southeast Asian countries, which limits its influence and acceptance in the region.\n\nASEAN has adopted a pragmatic stance in the U.S.-China rivalry, striving to remain neutral and autonomous in great power competition. This strategy allows ASEAN countries to benefit economically and in terms of security from both the U.S. and China, but it also leads to fragmented and unstable regional cooperation.\n\nResearch by the RAND Corporation points out that U.S. strategy in Southeast Asia is difficult to implement partly due to a lack of deep understanding of the complex political and social environment in the region. U.S. policymakers need to pay more attention to the internal dynamics and specific needs of Southeast Asian countries to develop more effective regional cooperation frameworks.\nASEAN's decision-making mechanism is primarily based on consensus, while the EU uses majority voting, leading ASEAN to place greater emphasis on consensus and coordination among member states, whereas the EU can make decisions more quickly and push policies forward. ASEAN's decision-making mechanism helps maintain harmony among member states but can also result in low decision-making efficiency, especially in complex or multilateral issues.\n\nThe EU has stronger supranational institutions, such as the European Commission, European Parliament, and European Court of Justice, which have high autonomy and enforcement power in policy formulation and implementation. In contrast, ASEAN's supranational institutions are relatively weak, relying mainly on voluntary cooperation and coordination among member states, which to some extent limits the strength and effectiveness of policy implementation.\n\nASEAN's institutional development is relatively slow, partly because its member states have significant differences in economic development levels, political systems, and cultural backgrounds, while EU member states have higher homogeneity in these aspects. This enables the EU to more effectively promote institutional development, while ASEAN requires more time and effort to overcome differences among member states and achieve a higher level of regional integration.</learnings>\n"

Additionally, the domestic instability caused by the coup impacted foreign investors' confidence, further affecting regional economic cooperation.\n\nThe coup had a negative impact on ASEAN's internal unity and decision-making mechanisms. After the Thai coup, ASEAN member states had differing views on how to respond to the situation in Thailand, exposing the limitations and lack of a unified response mechanism within ASEAN for dealing with internal political crises in member states. This event highlighted the challenges ASEAN faces in maintaining regional stability and promoting cooperation.\nMalaysia and Indonesia's roles and historical backgrounds in ASEAN regional integration have significantly influenced their policy-making and regional cooperation models. Both countries have undergone transitions from Cold War-era opposition to later economic cooperation. Malaysia's economic reforms and industrialization accelerated significantly in the 1970s and 1980s, while Indonesia achieved economic stability and growth under Suharto's regime. These different historical paths have had a profound impact on how both countries cooperate within the ASEAN framework.\n\nThe cultural diversity of Malaysia and Indonesia presents unique challenges and opportunities for regional integration. Malaysia's multi-ethnic society, including Malays, Chinese, and Indians, and Indonesia's over 300 ethnic groups and 700 languages, require complex social and cultural factors to be considered in policy-making. This cultural diversity has promoted inclusive and diverse strategies in regional cooperation but has also increased the difficulty of coordination and integration.\n\nEconomic cooperation between Malaysia and Indonesia within ASEAN has evolved from early trade liberalization to deeper economic integration. Both countries played key roles in establishing the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). These economic cooperation mechanisms not only boosted trade and investment between the two countries but also provided a model for other ASEAN member states, driving the economic integration process across the region.\nThe poverty issues in Cambodia and Laos have specific impacts on ASEAN economic cooperation, particularly in the advancement of poverty reduction projects. Cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in poverty reduction has achieved significant results through various means such as financial support, technical training, and project implementation, effectively enhancing the poverty reduction capabilities of these two countries.\n\nThe persistence of poverty poses a challenge to economic integration within ASEAN. High poverty rates in Cambodia and Laos not only affect the economic development of these two countries but also negatively impact the economic cooperation and market integration processes in the entire ASEAN region. Addressing this issue requires strengthening regional cooperation and policy coordination.\n\nChina-ASEAN poverty reduction cooperation extends beyond bilateral efforts to include multilateral frameworks, such as the 'Lancang-Mekong Cooperation' mechanism. These multilateral cooperation projects have played a crucial role in poverty reduction in Cambodia and Laos, providing valuable experiences and models for other ASEAN member states.\nChina's economic partnership with ASEAN countries has been instrumental in poverty reduction cooperation. Through a series of bilateral and multilateral projects, China has provided substantial assistance in infrastructure construction, agricultural technology promotion, education, and health, significantly improving living standards in ASEAN countries.\n\nThe White Paper 'China's International Development Cooperation in the New Era' emphasizes that China's interventions in Southeast Asia go beyond economic aid to include promoting the establishment and strengthening of regional cooperation mechanisms, such as the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation mechanism, which have facilitated trade and investment liberalization and enhanced regional economic integration.\n\nIn its specific intervention measures in Southeast Asia, China places particular emphasis on capacity building and training programs to enhance local human resource levels. For example, the China-ASEAN Training Center has trained a large number of officials and technicians from ASEAN countries, improving their governance and management capabilities.\nThere are significant differences in institutional development between ASEAN and the EU. The EU has established a highly institutionalized governance structure through a series of treaties and agreements, including supranational institutions like the European Parliament and the European Commission. In contrast, ASEAN prefers flexible, consensus-based decision-making mechanisms and lacks similar supranational institutions. This difference reflects the EU's goal of deep economic and political integration, while ASEAN focuses on maintaining the sovereignty and flexibility of its member states.\n\nIn terms of policy implementation, the EU ensures member states comply with common policies through directly applicable laws and strict supervision mechanisms. The EU's legal framework and enforcement mechanisms give it stronger execution capabilities in areas such as environmental protection, trade policy, and immigration management, whereas ASEAN's policy enforcement in these areas is relatively weak, relying more on voluntary actions by member states and regional coordination.\n\nASEAN and the EU also differ in their practices of multilateralism in regional governance. The EU actively participates in global governance as a unified actor on the international stage, playing an important role in international affairs through its Common Foreign and Security Policy. While ASEAN also emphasizes multilateralism, it relies more on regional cooperation mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN Plus Three mechanism to maintain regional stability and promote economic development.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The political turmoil in Thailand and Myanmar has exacerbated divisions within ASEAN, affecting the efficiency and unity of regional cooperation. Thailand's policy towards Myanmar reflects ASEAN's principle of 'non-interference in internal affairs,' but this approach appears inadequate in addressing Myanmar's ongoing domestic crisis, limiting the depth and breadth of regional cooperation. The concept of open regionalism in ASEAN has exposed its limitations in coordinating member states' interests and actions when facing instability in Myanmar and Thailand, necessitating further institutional innovation and policy adjustments.\n\nThe cultural and historical differences between Malaysia and Indonesia pose specific challenges to regional integration, particularly in coordinating economic and social policies. For example, Malaysia's religious and ethnic diversity is more complex, while Indonesia faces greater geographical dispersion issues, making it difficult to implement unified regional policies.\n\nDespite these challenges, the historical ties between Malaysia and Indonesia provide significant opportunities for regional integration. The similarities in language, religion, and culture between the two countries can promote closer economic cooperation and social exchange, especially in trade and tourism. Additionally, their shared history of resistance against colonial rule provides a solid foundation for cooperation in regional security and politics.\n\nTechnological advancements and the development of the digital economy have created new opportunities for Malaysia and Indonesia in regional integration. Both countries can enhance cooperation in digital infrastructure and innovation ecosystems to jointly address the challenges of the digital economy. For instance, establishing regional data centers and mechanisms for cross-border data flow can facilitate efficient sharing of information and resources, thereby accelerating regional economic integration and development.\n\nOne specific impact of poverty in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar on ASEAN economic cooperation is that high poverty rates in these countries limit the region's overall economic growth potential. According to World Bank data, the poverty rate in Cambodia was 13.5% in 2020, in Laos 17.6%, and in Myanmar 24.8%. These high poverty rates not only affect the internal development of these countries but also limit their participation in ASEAN economic integration, leading to slow progress in regional economic cooperation.\n\nAnother key learning is that poverty in these countries is particularly severe in rural areas, with rural poverty rates far higher than urban areas. This exacerbates the imbalance between urban and rural development and leads to a large outflow of rural labor, further weakening the productivity and economic vitality of rural areas. For example, the rural poverty rate in Laos is 22.2%, while the urban poverty rate is only 4.7%. This urban-rural gap poses a challenge to the sustainability of regional economic cooperation.\n\nFinally, ASEAN has taken various measures to address poverty, including promoting poverty reduction cooperation through the establishment of the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC). The ASCC implements a series of projects and programs aimed at improving education and health conditions, promoting economic diversification, and rural development in these countries. For example, during the period from 2016 to 2025, ASEAN launched the 'ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community 2025 Blueprint,' which emphasizes poverty reduction and social inclusion goals. These measures help enhance the region's overall economic resilience but require more international support and regional coordination.\n\nU.S. and Chinese interventions in Southeast Asia primarily focus on geopolitical and economic fields, influencing regional cooperation through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms. The U.S. strengthens military cooperation with traditional allies such as the Philippines and Thailand and advances the 'Indo-Pacific Strategy' to counter China's influence in the region. China, on the other hand, enhances economic ties with Southeast Asian countries through initiatives like the 'Belt and Road Initiative' and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), promoting regional infrastructure construction.\n\nU.S. security interventions in Southeast Asia have led to military tensions in the region, particularly regarding the South China Sea issue, which has intensified conflicts between China and some Southeast Asian countries. This tension affects the cooperative atmosphere within the region, leading some countries to adopt more cautious and balanced foreign policies to avoid being drawn into great power rivalries.\n\nChina's economic intervention in Southeast Asia has not only promoted regional infrastructure construction but also supported local economic development through loans and investments. However, this has raised concerns about debt traps and economic dependence, leading some countries to adopt a more cautious attitude towards China's economic intervention and seek diversified economic cooperation to reduce reliance on a single country.\n\nThe institutional differences between the EU and ASEAN in multilateralism practices mainly stem from their different historical backgrounds and political structures. The EU has a higher degree of institutionalization, thanks to long-term economic and political integration among its member states and common security and defense policies. In contrast, ASEAN has a lower degree of institutionalization, relying more on consensus and informal consultations, with significant economic and political differences among member states, leading to more flexible but less efficient policy implementation.\n\nThe EU's diplomatic and security policies in East Asia reflect its pursuit of autonomy and strategic interests rather than simply following the U.S. The EU seeks to play a larger role in the Asia-Pacific region by strengthening dialogue and cooperation with ASEAN, particularly in trade, climate change, and security. This autonomy is evident in the EU's interactions with ASEAN, where it promotes regional stability and prosperity through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.\n\nASEAN's governance model emphasizes sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, reflecting the diversity and historical background of its member states. ASEAN makes decisions through the ASEAN Way, emphasizing consensus and informality, which has certain advantages in handling regional conflicts and cooperation but also limits its rapid response capability in addressing complex challenges. The EU, on the other hand, relies more on legal and institutional frameworks in decision-making to ensure policy consistency and enforcement.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The background of the 'Double Reduction' policy is to alleviate the excessive homework burden and off-campus training burden on primary and secondary school students, aiming to optimize the educational ecosystem and promote the all-round development of students. The policy was jointly issued by the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council, reflecting the highest decision-making level's high regard and determination for educational issues. Specific measures include strictly controlling the total amount of homework, ensuring that no written homework is assigned to first and second graders in primary school, and that the average daily written homework completion time for other grades in primary school does not exceed 60 minutes, and 90 minutes for junior high school; at the same time, it is strictly prohibited for off-campus training institutions to organize subject-based training during national statutory holidays, rest days, and summer and winter vacations, to reduce students' extracurricular burdens.\n\nThe 'Double Reduction' policy has significantly improved satisfaction with junior high school education, reflecting the initial effectiveness of the policy in reducing students' burdens and improving educational quality. By reducing after-school tutoring classes and homework burdens, students have more time for personalized learning and interest cultivation, thereby enhancing overall educational satisfaction.\n\nThe logic behind the 'Double Reduction' policy lies in reducing the pressure of exam-oriented education and promoting comprehensive reforms in basic education. The policy aims to break the single evaluation system of exam-oriented education and promote the all-round development of students, including improvements in moral, physical, artistic, and labor education.\n\nDuring the implementation of the 'Double Reduction' policy, it has leveraged a major reform in basic education, affecting multiple links in the education industry chain. From the rectification of off-campus training institutions to the improvement of in-school educational quality, the implementation of the policy has not only changed students' daily learning patterns but also promoted innovation in teaching methods and optimization of educational management mechanisms.\n\nThe 'Double Reduction' policy is driving the modernization of the education sector, emphasizing the reduction of students' extracurricular burdens and the improvement of classroom teaching quality, aiming to build a fairer and more efficient educational system. Educational departments and schools are actively exploring new teaching models, such as online education, blended learning, and project-based learning, to enhance students' learning experiences and outcomes.\n\nUnder the guidance of the 'Double Reduction' policy, the role of the main educational arena has become more prominent, with schools and teachers being given greater responsibility and autonomy to innovate teaching methods and content. This not only requires teachers to have higher professional competence but also promotes investment in teacher training and professional development, enhancing overall educational quality.\n\nAfter the implementation of the policy, off-campus tutoring institutions face transformation pressures, with many institutions shifting to non-subject-based training, such as art, sports, and science education, to meet the diverse needs of students and parents. This transformation not only reduces students' extracurricular burdens but also promotes the diversification of the education market, providing new opportunities for educational innovation.\n\nThe 'Double Reduction' policy aims to reduce students' extracurricular burdens and off-campus training pressures, promoting educational equity and quality improvement. The policy emphasizes the public welfare nature of education, requiring off-campus training institutions not to organize subject-based training during national statutory holidays, rest days, and summer and winter vacations, thereby reducing the economic burden on students and parents and promoting the balanced distribution of educational resources.\n\nThe implementation of the 'Double Reduction' policy has restructured the educational ecosystem, promoting positive interactions between in-school education and off-campus training. The policy encourages schools to improve teaching quality, extend after-school service hours, and meet students' diverse learning needs, while regulating the behavior of off-campus training institutions to return them to their role as supplements to in-school education rather than replacements or disruptions.\n\nThe implementation of the 'Double Reduction' policy has had a profound impact on the education market, forcing off-campus training institutions to transform or exit the market. After the implementation of the policy, many off-campus training institutions faced rectification or closure, and the investment enthusiasm in the education industry has significantly decreased, with capital intervention in the education sector strictly limited. This helps purify the educational environment, reduce the negative impacts of exam-oriented education, and promote the all-round development of students.\n\nParents' educational anxiety after the implementation of the 'Double Reduction' policy mainly focuses on concerns about their children's academic performance and uncertainty about future educational paths. After the policy was implemented, many parents were confused about how to maintain or improve their children's academic performance without after-school tutoring, and this anxiety is particularly evident among middle-income families who rely on after-school tutoring to make up for deficiencies in school education.\n\nThe 'Double Reduction' policy has prompted parents and students to pay more attention to quality education and interest cultivation, rather than solely focusing on exam-oriented education. Many parents are exploring diverse educational paths, such as art, sports, and science interest classes, to develop their children's comprehensive qualities and interests. This change reflects a gradual shift in parental educational concepts from a focus on grades to a greater emphasis on the all-round development of their children.\n\nStudents' adaptation varies individually, but overall, students have shown more autonomous learning abilities and time management skills after the policy was implemented. Some students, free from the pressure of after-school tutoring, can better manage their study and leisure time, improving their learning efficiency. At the same time, some schools and educational institutions have actively adjusted their teaching strategies, providing more autonomous learning resources and support to help students better adapt to the new educational environment.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>\"The 'Double Reduction' policy has led to a repositioning of vocational education, emphasizing the cultivation of skills and practical abilities rather than solely pursuing academic achievements. This policy adjustment has encouraged vocational schools to strengthen their cooperation with enterprises, promoting innovation in school-enterprise collaboration models to better meet the market's demand for skilled talent.\n\nUnder the 'Double Reduction' policy, higher education institutions face increased pressure, especially those that rely on after-school tutoring and training. The implementation of the policy has led to a shrinkage in the after-school training industry, affecting the enrollment and quality of students at higher education institutions. Many higher education institutions have begun to adjust their admission strategies, placing greater emphasis on vocational skills and practical experience to adapt to the new educational environment.\n\nThe 'Double Reduction' policy has also prompted educational training institutions to transform, with many exploring new business directions such as adult education, vocational training, and online education. This transformation not only mitigates the impact of the policy but also brings new opportunities to the vocational education market, promoting its diversified development.\nRural-urban education disparities affect the implementation of the 'Double Reduction' policy in rural areas. A case study in Y District of Chongqing shows that rural parents' views on the 'Double Reduction' policy differ significantly from those of urban parents. Rural parents are more concerned about their children's basic education and fundamental skill development, with lower demand for after-school training. Therefore, the implementation of the 'Double Reduction' policy in rural areas has limited effects, failing to significantly reduce parents' economic burden and educational anxiety.\n\nThe 'Double Reduction' policy exhibits different characteristics in after-school services in urban and rural primary schools. After-school services in urban primary schools are more diverse, including interest classes, tutoring sessions, and club activities, which can better meet the needs of students and parents. In contrast, after-school services in rural primary schools are resource-poor and monotonous, making it difficult to provide a variety of options, leading to less significant effects of the 'Double Reduction' policy in rural primary schools compared to urban ones.\n\nA case study in Y District of Chongqing indicates that although the 'Double Reduction' policy aims to reduce students' extracurricular burdens, the uneven distribution of educational resources between urban and rural areas has increased the difficulty of implementing this policy. Urban areas have richer educational resources, giving parents and students more choices, while rural areas have limited resources, resulting in lower responsiveness and benefits from the policy among parents and students.\n\nThe effectiveness of international education policies varies significantly across countries. For example, Singapore has significantly improved its education system's international competitiveness through comprehensive international education programs, including attracting international students and teachers, establishing international schools and curricula, increasing the proportion of international students from 8% in 2010 to 15% in 2020.\n\nIn Europe, Finland's education policy focuses on improving education quality rather than international rankings, reducing standardized testing and increasing teacher autonomy, successfully enhancing overall student academic performance, with Finnish students consistently ranking in the top five in reading and math in PISA tests.\n\nThe United States' international education policy emphasizes attracting international students and enhancing research collaboration, but due to uncertainties in visa policies, the number of international students decreased by 10% between 2016 and 2020, impacting the fiscal revenue and international diversity of higher education institutions.\n\nThe impact of the 'Double Reduction' policy on teacher team building is mainly reflected in the following aspects: the policy requires schools to increase after-school services, which means a significant increase in teachers' working hours and workload. Schools need to reasonably arrange teachers' work and rest times to ensure the stability of the teaching staff and maintain teaching quality.\n\nThe demand for teacher training has significantly increased to adapt to the teaching reforms under the 'Double Reduction' policy. The policy emphasizes improving classroom teaching quality and efficiency and reducing the burden of homework, requiring teachers to master more diverse teaching methods and skills, such as project-based learning and interdisciplinary teaching, to enhance students' learning interest and autonomous learning ability.\n\nThe 'Double Reduction' policy has prompted schools to place greater emphasis on teachers' professional development and career growth. The implementation of the policy requires schools to establish a more comprehensive teacher evaluation system, focusing on teachers' overall qualities and teaching effectiveness, providing more training opportunities and career development paths to motivate teachers' enthusiasm and creativity, thereby improving overall educational quality.\n\nAfter the implementation of the 'Double Reduction' policy, parents' educational anxiety has been somewhat alleviated but not completely eliminated. Although the policy has reduced the burden of after-school training, some parents still worry about their children's academic performance and future competitiveness, especially in admissions to key high schools and universities. Parents' anxiety mainly centers on how to ensure their children can access quality educational resources and improve academic performance while reducing after-school training.\n\nThe 'Double Reduction' policy has had a significant impact on household educational expenditure, with a substantial reduction in spending on after-school training. However, to compensate for the reduction in after-school training, parents have increased internal educational investment, such as purchasing educational books, online courses, and home tutoring. Despite the overall decrease in educational expenditure, the increase in internal educational investment partially offsets this trend.\n\nParents' educational concepts have gradually changed under the impetus of the 'Double Reduction' policy, placing greater emphasis on their children's overall qualities and interest development. Parents are paying more attention to their children's physical and mental health and interest development, rather than just academic achievements. This shift in mindset has led parents to prioritize diversity and personalization when choosing educational resources, no longer solely pursuing high scores and prestigious schools.</learnings>\n"

These disparities are often exacerbated by regional variations in economic development, where wealthier areas attract more healthcare providers and infrastructure, leaving poorer regions underserved.\n\nHealthcare policies and funding mechanisms can perpetuate inequalities, as they often favor urban and affluent areas over rural and economically disadvantaged regions. This can result in a concentration of medical facilities, specialized services, and qualified healthcare professionals in areas with higher economic activity, further marginalizing less prosperous communities.\n\nSocial determinants of health, such as education, employment, and housing, play a critical role in shaping health outcomes and access to healthcare. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often face multiple barriers, including limited health literacy, reduced access to preventive care, and higher exposure to environmental risks, which collectively contribute to poorer health outcomes and a greater need for healthcare resources.\nThe United Nations emphasizes the importance of reducing inequality within and among countries as a critical strategy to address healthcare resource distribution inequality, highlighting the need for international cooperation and policy reforms to ensure equitable access to healthcare resources.\n\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) proposes a promising approach to addressing health inequalities through evidence-based interventions, such as targeted programs that focus on marginalized and vulnerable populations, emphasizing the role of data-driven strategies in identifying and addressing specific healthcare needs.\n\nPromoting equity in health resource allocation requires a multi-faceted approach that includes both top-down policy changes and bottom-up community engagement, ensuring that resources are distributed based on need rather than socioeconomic status, and that health systems are responsive to the diverse needs of different populations.\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) implemented the 'Fair Shares' program, which used a formula-based approach to allocate resources based on population health needs, resulting in a 15% reduction in health inequalities between the most and least deprived areas over a five-year period.\n\nIn Sweden, the introduction of the 'Healthcare Guarantee' ensured that patients in underserved regions had access to specialist care within a specified time frame, leading to a 20% increase in patient satisfaction and a 10% reduction in emergency room visits in rural areas.\n\nIn the United States, the Community Health Worker (CHW) model, particularly in the state of Massachusetts, demonstrated significant improvements in patient outcomes and cost savings. CHWs provided culturally competent care and navigation services, leading to a 25% reduction in hospital readmissions and a 12% decrease in Medicaid expenditures.\nComprehensive medical reform can enhance the efficiency of healthcare systems by streamlining resource allocation, reducing waste, and improving patient outcomes, as evidenced by successful implementations in countries like Sweden and Germany, where reforms have led to significant reductions in healthcare costs and improved access to services.\n\nUnequal economic development within and between developed countries contributes to inequitable distribution of healthcare resources, resulting in disparities in health outcomes and access to care. For example, regions with higher economic disparities, such as rural areas in the United States, often have fewer healthcare facilities and a lower density of healthcare professionals, exacerbating health inequalities.\n\nPolicy interventions aimed at redistributing healthcare resources, such as targeted funding and incentive programs for healthcare providers in underserved areas, can mitigate the effects of economic disparities and improve access to care. Countries like the United Kingdom have implemented such policies with notable success, leading to more equitable healthcare resource distribution and better health outcomes in previously underserved regions.\nAdvanced Telehealth Platforms are revolutionizing healthcare resource distribution by enabling remote consultations, chronic disease management, and real-time monitoring. These platforms utilize AI and IoT to enhance patient care, reduce hospital readmissions, and lower healthcare costs. For example, a study in the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare found that telehealth interventions reduced hospital readmissions by 30% and decreased emergency department visits by 25%.\n\nBlockchain technology is being leveraged to improve the transparency and efficiency of healthcare supply chains. By creating immutable records of transactions, blockchain can ensure the traceability of medical supplies, reduce fraud, and optimize inventory management. A pilot project by IBM and Pfizer demonstrated a 40% reduction in supply chain errors and a 20% decrease in inventory costs.\n\nSmart city initiatives are integrating healthcare services with urban infrastructure to create more accessible and efficient healthcare systems. These initiatives include the deployment of mobile health units, smart ambulances, and integrated health data platforms.

For example, targeted funding and resource allocation to underserved areas have been effective in improving access to primary care and preventive services, as evidenced by a 20% increase in vaccination rates in low-income communities in the United Kingdom.\n\nCommunity-based interventions, such as health promotion programs and mobile health clinics, have demonstrated effectiveness in addressing specific health needs and reducing disparities. These programs often leverage local partnerships and community engagement, leading to higher participation rates and better health outcomes. In Australia, a community health initiative in rural areas resulted in a 15% reduction in hospital readmissions for chronic conditions.\n\nEvaluations of policy measures have highlighted the importance of a multi-sectoral approach, integrating health policies with social, economic, and environmental policies to address the root causes of health inequalities. This holistic approach has been shown to have a more sustained impact on reducing health disparities. For instance, a coordinated effort in Sweden involving healthcare, education, and housing policies led to a 10% reduction in the gap in life expectancy between the most and least affluent regions over a five-year period.\nAdvanced telehealth platforms in developed countries have significantly improved healthcare resource distribution by enabling remote consultations and specialist access, particularly in rural and underserved areas, reducing travel time and increasing patient satisfaction. For example, a 2024 study in the United States found that telehealth visits increased by 40% in rural regions, leading to a 25% reduction in emergency room visits and a 15% decrease in hospital readmissions.\n\nTelehealth has facilitated the integration of health information technology (HIT) systems, enhancing data sharing and interoperability among healthcare providers. This has resulted in more efficient care coordination and reduced medical errors. A case study from a major hospital network in Australia reported a 30% improvement in care coordination and a 20% reduction in medication errors within the first year of implementing an advanced telehealth platform.\n\nThe adoption of advanced telehealth platforms has also led to cost savings for both healthcare systems and patients. In the United Kingdom, a comprehensive telehealth program reduced overall healthcare costs by 18% over a three-year period, primarily through reduced inpatient stays and lower transportation costs. Additionally, patient satisfaction scores improved by 22%, indicating a positive impact on both financial and qualitative outcomes.\nEffective health research systems are crucial for resilient healthcare resource distribution, as evidenced by the rapid response and adaptation seen in countries with robust research infrastructures during the Mpox outbreak.

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The education models in East Asian countries are deeply influenced by historical backgrounds, especially in terms of quality assurance in higher education. From the perspective of historical institutionalism, changes in basic education policies in Southeast Asia reflect the dual drive of external pressures and internal reforms, such as interventions from international organizations and the needs for domestic socio-economic development.\n\nIn the pursuit of global competitiveness, the education models in East Asian countries have undergone a transformation from traditional exam-oriented education to a greater emphasis on innovation and practical skills. During this process, governments and educational institutions actively introduced international standards and evaluation systems to improve educational quality and international recognition.\n\nScholar Fu Tao Huang points out that the development of international higher education in Asia is not only influenced by historical factors but also faces new challenges brought by globalization. These challenges include how to maintain local characteristics while adapting to international educational trends, and how to achieve both educational equity and quality improvement under limited resources.\n\nThe education model in East Asian countries has been significantly influenced by the Prussian education system, which to some extent forces students into a vicious cycle, emphasizing strict discipline and competition, potentially harming their physical and mental health. This model is widely present in East Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea, reflecting the pursuit of high academic achievements and social status.\n\nClassical Chinese culture plays a foundational role in the future development of East Asian civilization, emphasizing the importance of traditional culture in modern education. An article from the Jiangsu Think Tank Network points out that classical Chinese culture not only provides rich historical and philosophical resources but also offers ethical and moral guidance for the modern education system, helping to cultivate students' comprehensive qualities and humanistic literacy.\n\nFrom the perspective of cultural interaction studies, the formation of early cultural landscapes in East Asia was a process of interaction and integration of diverse cultures. An article from the China Social Sciences Network points out that this process included the spread of cultural elements such as Chinese characters and Confucian thought, as well as the exchange and integration of religious ideas such as Buddhism and Taoism. These cultural traditions still play important roles in the education models of East Asian countries.\n\nThe modernization of East Asian education faces serious issues of resource waste. A Nobel laureate from Japan pointed out that the current education system consumes too much life and time without effectively cultivating innovation and independent thinking abilities. This view emphasizes the urgency of educational reform, particularly at the higher education level, where more attention should be paid to students' individual development and the cultivation of innovative capabilities.\n\nAlthough East Asian countries have achieved certain successes in late-developing educational modernization, they also face numerous challenges. In 'Changes and Challenges in Quality Assurance in East Asian Higher Education,' Fu Tao Huang points out that research from historical and comparative perspectives shows that these countries still have deficiencies in quality assurance, requiring reforms at policy and practice levels to improve educational quality and international competitiveness.\n\nThe advantage of late-developing educational modernization lies in being able to draw on the experiences of developed countries, but it also brings issues of cultural adaptation and localization. The article 'Late-Developing Educational Modernization in Comparative Perspective' points out that East Asian countries need to balance the introduction of advanced external concepts with local cultural traditions to ensure the success and sustainable development of educational reforms.\n\nThe performance of East Asian countries in the PISA 2018 reading literacy test showed significant differences, reflecting variations in educational policies and teaching methods across countries. For example, Singapore, Shanghai (China), and South Korea performed excellently in reading literacy, while Japan and Taiwan (China) performed relatively poorly. These performance differences reveal different effects of educational investment, teacher training, and curriculum design across countries.\n\nFu Tao Huang's research indicates that East Asian countries have experienced significant changes in higher education quality assurance, facing multiple challenges. These changes include a shift from a single government-led approach to a diversified quality assurance system, introducing international evaluation standards and third-party evaluation agencies. These reforms aim to enhance educational transparency and international competitiveness but also bring regulatory complexity and resource allocation challenges.\n\nHistorical and comparative analysis shows that East Asian countries, in the formulation and implementation of educational policies, have both drawn on the experiences of Western countries and retained local characteristics. For example, Japan's educational reforms, while introducing Western educational concepts, still emphasize collectivism and discipline; while China, in promoting educational equity and quality improvement, strengthens the inheritance and education of traditional culture. This integration and innovation provide valuable references for other developing countries.\n\nThe quality assurance system in East Asian higher education has undergone significant historical changes and faces new challenges. Fu Tao Huang's research points out that East Asian countries have experienced a shift from government-led to diversified and multi-stakeholder participation in higher education quality assurance, a process influenced by globalization and international competition. Currently, these countries are striving to maintain local characteristics while enhancing international competitiveness in education.\n\nA Nobel laureate from Japan has made sharp criticisms of the East Asian education model, arguing that it wastes too much life. Specifically, the East Asian education system overemphasizes academic achievements and exam competition, leading to immense pressure on students, sacrificing personal development and quality of life. This view has sparked widespread discussions on the sustainability of the East Asian education model, particularly in terms of mental health and social adaptability.\n\nEast Asian countries perform excellently in international educational assessments, but the inherent problems of their education models cannot be ignored. Despite often topping international assessments like PISA, East Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea hide issues of high exam pressure and uneven distribution of educational resources behind these achievements. This suggests that we need to evaluate the success of the education system more comprehensively, rather than focusing solely on academic performance.</learnings>\n"

For instance, China's education system has undergone major reforms since the 1980s, emphasizing universal primary education and expanding higher education, while Japan's system has traditionally been centralized and examination-driven, reflecting its post-World War II emphasis on rapid industrialization and economic growth.\n\nIn contrast, South Korea's education system has been characterized by a strong focus on meritocracy and academic achievement, driven by the legacy of Confucianism and the country's rapid economic development from the 1960s onwards. This has resulted in a highly competitive and rigorous educational environment, with a significant emphasis on STEM fields and higher education.\n\nSingapore's education system, while also influenced by Confucian values, has been more diversified and pragmatic, integrating both Eastern and Western educational practices. The government has actively promoted bilingualism and a curriculum that emphasizes critical thinking and innovation, aligning with its strategy to position Singapore as a global hub for knowledge and technology.\nYigong Shi pointed out in discussions about exam-oriented education that although it can improve students' knowledge levels and test scores in the short term, in the long run, it suppresses students' creativity and critical thinking abilities, leading to an over-reliance on standardized answers and a lack of innovative problem-solving skills and self-motivated learning.\n\nIn the optimization of the education分流 system, it is mentioned that while the分流 system commonly adopted in East Asian countries ensures a certain level of educational equity and rational allocation of resources, it also has obvious drawbacks. For example, early分流 may limit some students to lower educational tracks at an early stage, restricting their future potential.\n\nThe podcast 'Xiao Yuzhou' mentioned that although the education training industry has shown signs of recovery after the pandemic, deep-rooted problems in East Asian education systems have not been fundamentally resolved. These issues include excessive competition, blind pursuit of high scores by parents and society, and a disconnect between educational content and practical needs, all of which contribute to high student stress and frequent mental health problems.\nEast Asian countries perform exceptionally well in international educational assessments such as PISA, particularly in mathematics, reading, and science. For example, Shanghai achieved the highest global scores in the 2003 PISA mathematics and science assessments, significantly above the OECD average. This outstanding performance reflects the efficiency and depth of East Asian education systems in teaching foundational subjects.\n\nThe success of East Asian education is partly attributed to a highly competitive social environment and the high value placed on education by parents. In these countries, families have high expectations for their children's academic achievements and invest substantial time and resources, including after-school tutoring and homework supervision. This strong social and family support system provides students with powerful motivation and a sustained learning environment.\n\nEast Asian education systems also exhibit unique advantages in teaching methods and educational management. Teachers in these countries often receive more rigorous professional training, and teaching resources and facilities are more advanced. Additionally, educational policies are more systematic and scientific, focusing on students' foundational knowledge and skill development while emphasizing test scores and performance in subject competitions. This system not only improves students' academic performance but also enhances their competitive edge in the international arena.\nEast Asian education models tend to emphasize academic achievement, which, to some extent, sacrifices students' mental health. Studies show that this high-pressure learning environment leads to a higher incidence of mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, especially in South Korea and Japan.\n\nSocial adaptability is often overlooked in East Asian education systems, making students more vulnerable when facing social challenges. For example, in the education systems of South Korea and Japan, there is insufficient cultivation of teamwork and emotional intelligence, which manifests as a lack of social skills and professional adaptability when students enter society.\n\nEast Asian countries are gradually recognizing the importance of mental health and social adaptability and are beginning to implement reforms. For example, China and Singapore have recently introduced more elements focused on students' mental health in their education policies, such as mental health education courses and school psychological counseling services, aiming to improve students' overall well-being and development.\nChina's higher education aims to balance indigenous culture and international trends through the implementation of the 'Double First-Class' initiative, which seeks to enhance universities' international competitiveness while ensuring the inheritance of indigenous cultural education. This policy not only emphasizes the introduction of high-quality international educational resources but also focuses on cultivating talents with both an international perspective and a deep understanding of indigenous culture to meet the complex demands of globalization.\n\nTo achieve a balance between internationalization and localization in education, East Asian countries generally strengthen language education, particularly bilingual teaching in Chinese and English. For example, universities in South Korea and Japan have opened Chinese language courses and intensified English teaching to promote students' cross-cultural communication skills, ensuring they can master international languages while maintaining a profound understanding of their own cultures.\n\nEast Asian countries' education policies also actively support international student exchange programs, providing rich opportunities through cooperation with overseas universities. These programs not only help students broaden their international perspectives but also promote cultural exchange and understanding, thereby achieving the integration of indigenous culture and internationalization in practice.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>China has emphasized both equity and quality in its education policy reforms, significantly narrowing the educational gap between urban and rural areas through the implementation of the 'Balanced Development of Compulsory Education' policy. For example, from 2015 to 2020, the nine-year compulsory education consolidation rate in rural areas increased from 92.7% to 95.3%, while in urban areas it rose from 97.5% to 98.8%.\n\nJapan's education reform focuses on enhancing students' comprehensive qualities and innovation capabilities. By revising the 'Course of Study' (Gakushu Shidoh Youryou), more practical and inquiry-based learning content has been introduced. Since 2018, Japanese high schools have gradually implemented a new curriculum system that includes more project-based learning and interdisciplinary courses, which have significantly improved students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\nSingapore emphasizes cultivating students' international perspectives and multilingual abilities through the implementation of the 'Global Perspectives Programme' and the 'Bilingual Policy', ensuring that students master English while also being proficient in their mother tongue. In 2019, the Ministry of Education further promoted the 'FutureSchools@SG' project, using technology and innovative teaching methods to create multiple student-centered learning environments, significantly enhancing students' digital literacy and innovation capabilities.\nMental health issues among adolescents are becoming increasingly prominent in East Asian education models, and education departments have placed greater emphasis on this issue, stressing that schools, families, and society should work together to address it. The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China has explicitly stated that mental health work should be a priority in education, strengthening mental health education and counseling to improve students' psychological well-being and coping abilities. Mental health has been repeatedly highlighted in government work reports, with plans to fully integrate mental health education into the school education system by 2025 to address the growing trend of student mental health issues.\nEast Asian education models have achieved significant success in improving student academic performance but have had limited impact on social adaptability. Despite excellent performance in global education assessments such as PISA, students in these countries tend to perform relatively weakly in social skills like teamwork, innovative thinking, and emotional management. A World Bank report indicates that although East Asian countries have made significant progress in educational opportunities and quality, they still need to strengthen the cultivation of students' social adaptability.\n\nThe focus of education system reforms in East Asian countries is on improving educational quality and ensuring equity, but these reforms often overlook the integration of social and emotional learning (SEL). The World Bank points out that despite substantial investments in educational infrastructure and teacher training, there is insufficient attention to the cultivation of social and emotional skills in curriculum design and teaching methods. This has led to an imbalance between academic achievement and social adaptability.\n\nTo improve the education models in East Asian countries, SEL should be integrated into the curriculum, and teacher training should support this change. Specific measures include adding content on teamwork, communication skills, and emotional management to the curriculum, as well as providing professional SEL training for teachers. Additionally, schools should collaborate with families and communities to promote students' overall development, ensuring balanced growth in both academic and social adaptability.\nEast Asian countries have successfully balanced internationalization and localization in their education systems through international understanding education programs. For example, Japan's international understanding education program not only emphasizes foreign language learning but also focuses on cultural exchange activities and international student exchanges to enhance students' understanding and respect for different cultures. These programs not only boost students' international competitiveness but also reinforce their sense of identity with their own culture.\n\nSouth Korea has adopted a dual-track strategy of 'localization + internationalization' in its education internationalization process. By establishing international schools and offering international curricula, South Korea attracts foreign students while encouraging local students to participate. South Korean international schools not only offer International Baccalaureate (IB) programs but also incorporate Korean history and culture courses, ensuring that students maintain their roots in an international environment. This dual-track strategy effectively balances the internationalization and localization of education.\n\nSingapore promotes the deep integration of internationalization and localization at the national policy level. The Singapore government clearly stipulates in its education policies that schools must provide both international education and local cultural education. For example, schools in Singapore teach international curricula while requiring students to learn local languages such as Chinese and Malay, as well as Singapore's history and culture. This policy ensures that students maintain a deep understanding and identification with their own culture in an international learning environment.\nOne specific challenge faced by East Asian countries in transitioning from exam-oriented education to innovative education is the rigidity of the education system and reliance on traditional exam-oriented education. This reliance leads to a lack of creativity and critical thinking skills among students, making it difficult for them to adapt to rapidly changing market demands. For instance, although South Korea and Japan perform excellently in international academic assessments, they lag behind in innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. Both countries have attempted to introduce more practical and project-based learning, but progress has been slow and results limited.\n\nSingapore has achieved some success in the transition from exam-oriented to innovative education, particularly in terms of policy support and flexibility in the education system. The Singapore government has established dedicated innovation and entrepreneurship education programs, such as the 'Innovation and Enterprise Programme', to encourage students to participate in real projects and develop their innovative thinking and practical skills. Additionally, Singapore's education system emphasizes interdisciplinary education, integrating knowledge from different disciplines to enhance students' comprehensive abilities.\n\nChina has made some significant achievements in the transition from exam-oriented to innovative education, especially in higher education reforms. For example, Duke Kunshan University, a model of Sino-foreign cooperative education, adopts the educational model of Duke University in the United States, emphasizing interdisciplinary education and the cultivation of critical thinking. The university provides rich innovative education experiences through small class sizes, project-based learning, and international faculty. Furthermore, the Chinese government has launched several policies, such as the 'Double First-Class' initiative, aimed at enhancing the overall level and innovation capabilities of higher education.</learnings>\n"

However, the following key learnings can be extracted:\n\nHigh rates of depression among adolescents are a significant concern in these countries, with 50% of depression patients being students, highlighting the critical need for mental health education and support in schools.\n\nExperts from China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore have convened to discuss and share best practices in mental health, indicating a collaborative approach to addressing mental health issues among youth in the region.\n\nThe focus on cultivating 'happiness' and resilience in students is emerging as a key strategy in mental health education, aiming to equip young people with the skills to manage stress and emotional challenges effectively.\nEast Asian countries have significantly improved students' overall quality through higher education reforms and policy support, focusing on enhancing students' social adaptability. For example, Sanya University in China hosted the 'Forum on Higher Education Prospects for Development', gathering domestic and international education experts to explore ways to improve students' social adaptability and overall quality. This forum not only promoted academic exchanges but also led to the implementation of several concrete measures, such as adding social practice courses, corporate internships, and community service activities, enabling students to better integrate into society.\n\nJapan's education system has strengthened students' life skills and social adaptability by introducing the 'Life Studies' (Seikatsu-ka) course. The Life Studies course covers topics such as household economic management, health and safety, environmental awareness, and community participation, aiming to cultivate students' independent living skills and social responsibility. This curriculum setting not only improves students' overall quality but also deepens their understanding of social issues.\n\nSouth Korea's educational reform focuses on fostering students' innovative spirit and practical abilities by introducing project-based learning (PBL) and entrepreneurship education, encouraging students to actively participate in social and economic activities. The South Korean government has launched the 'Youth Entrepreneurship Support Program', providing funding, guidance, and resources to students with entrepreneurial aspirations, helping them transform ideas into actual projects. These measures not only enhance students' social adaptability but also inject new vitality into South Korea's economic development.\nIn balancing internationalization and localization in education, China collaborates with international financial organizations to explore new funding support and policy innovation mechanisms to promote educational reform and development. This collaboration not only helps introduce advanced international educational concepts and practices but also ensures that the characteristics and needs of the local education system are fully considered. Through the proposal of the Assistant Minister of Finance, it is evident that China is taking an active and proactive approach to internationalizing education, aiming to improve educational quality through multilateral cooperation.\nIn the transition from exam-oriented education to innovative education, South Korea successfully transformed the traditional exam-oriented education model into a student-centered innovative education system through the 'Innovative Education Zone' program. Launched in 2013, this program aims to enhance students' innovation and practical skills by introducing project-based learning, interdisciplinary teaching, and personalized tutoring. By 2020, over 300 schools had participated in the program, with significant improvements in student satisfaction and teacher engagement, and a 50% increase in the number of innovative projects.\n\nJapan revised its 'Course of Study' in 2018, emphasizing the cultivation of students' comprehensive qualities and innovation capabilities. The new guidelines require schools to increase STEM education and information technology courses, reduce rote memorization, and focus on developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Since its implementation, students have shown significant improvement in international science and math competitions, particularly achieving third place in the 2021 International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nSingapore comprehensively reformed its education system through the '21st Century Competencies Framework', strengthening students' skills in critical thinking, innovation, and communication. Launched in 2010, this framework introduces interdisciplinary projects, makerspaces, and corporate collaborations, providing students with rich practical opportunities. By 2022, Singaporean students ranked fifth globally in innovation capability and have consistently been among the top performers in PISA tests in reading, mathematics, and science.\nWhile East Asian countries' education systems have achieved significant success in improving academic performance, this model often neglects the cultivation of students' social and emotional competencies, leading to significant deficiencies in mental health and social adaptability. Research shows that students in highly competitive and high-pressure educational environments are prone to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues, which exhibit persistent and cumulative effects in long-term tracking studies.\n\nAlthough East Asian countries' education systems have significantly improved academic performance, students under this model perform poorly in social adaptability, especially in teamwork, communication, and emotion management. These deficiencies not only affect students' performance during their school years but may also negatively impact their future career development and social relationships.\n\nIn recent years, some East Asian countries have begun to recognize this issue and have taken a series of measures, such as introducing emotional education courses and strengthening mental health support systems, to improve students' mental health and social adaptability. However, the effectiveness of these measures still needs further evaluation, and long-term tracking studies are required to verify their effectiveness and sustainability.</learnings>\n"

This theory provides a framework for understanding the practicality of language and reveals its central role in social interactions.\n\nGideon Toury's translation theory system explores issues and meanings in the translation process, emphasizing that translation is not just a conversion of language but also involves the transmission of cultural and social contexts. Toury introduces concepts of equivalence and dynamic equivalence in translation, providing new perspectives and methods for translation studies, especially in cross-cultural translation.\n\nThe redefinition of 'word' in modern Chinese reveals the complexity of linguistic units and proposes a comprehensive analysis method from phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic perspectives. This research challenges traditional single-dimensional definitions and emphasizes the multidimensionality and dynamism of linguistic units, providing a new theoretical foundation for Chinese lexicology.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, the definition and standards of coherence emphasize the interaction between ecological self and subject self, particularly in the construction of China's social service system. The development of social psychology needs to focus on building individual resilience. Building resilience is not only about enhancing personal psychological toughness but is also an important part of the social service system. By strengthening individual resilience, it can effectively enhance the overall stability of society and individual well-being. In this process, social psychology needs to combine China's specific social and cultural background to explore coherent theories and practical standards suitable for China's national conditions.\n\nIn Marxist philosophy, the generation path of the 'law' theory includes three dimensions: historical materialism, dialectical materialism, and practical materialism. These dimensions together form a philosophical understanding of coherence. Luo Yedan's research points out that these three dimensions provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the 'law' theory from the perspectives of historical development, dialectical logic, and practical testing, emphasizing the importance of coherence in the philosophical system. Through these paths, Marxist philosophy not only focuses on the internal logical consistency of the theory but also emphasizes the unity of theory and practice, thus ensuring its coherence and scientific nature.\n\nFrom an interdisciplinary perspective, the integration of computational thinking and humanities can promote the construction of new liberal arts. By applying computational methods and tools, the depth and breadth of humanities research can be enhanced, such as data mining, text analysis, and visualization techniques in history, literature, and philosophy, which help reveal new research perspectives and discoveries.\n\nSun Kuanning proposes that interdisciplinary design and implementation require clear paths and theoretical support, including clear interdisciplinary goals, effective collaboration mechanisms, and shared research platforms. He emphasizes that the success of interdisciplinary research depends not only on technical means but also on in-depth communication and cooperation among researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds to form consensus and a common research framework.\n\nThe coherence of educational knowledge emphasizes the importance of an interdisciplinary perspective in educational research. By integrating theories and methods from different disciplines, a more comprehensive understanding and solution to educational problems can be achieved. For example, the combination of psychology, sociology, and information technology can provide more scientific and diverse bases for educational policy-making, teaching design, and student assessment.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The application of coherence in linguistics not only manifests in the internal consistency and logical rigor of theoretical systems, but also requires theories to effectively explain and predict linguistic phenomena. Mr. Wang Li emphasized the coherence of theoretical frameworks when constructing the Chinese linguistics system, believing that only by building a logically rigorous theory that can explain various linguistic phenomena can the development of linguistics be promoted.\n\nThe evaluation criteria for coherence include internal consistency, the ability to explain external data, and predictive power. Internal consistency requires that there be no contradictions between different parts of the theory, and that they support each other; the ability to explain external data requires that the theory can account for existing linguistic data and phenomena; predictive power means that the theory can predict unobserved linguistic phenomena and verify these predictions through actual data.\n\nCoherence is also emphasized in the construction of courses in language resource studies. For example, at the seminar on the construction of the 'Language Resource Studies' course, participants discussed how to build a coherent course system so that students can systematically master relevant knowledge and skills in language resources, thereby better addressing challenges in practical applications.\nIn qualitative research in psychology, coherence emphasizes the consistency and logical coherence between research methods and research objectives. This coherence not only manifests in the rationality of data collection and analysis methods, but also requires researchers to maintain consistency between theoretical frameworks, research design, and result interpretation. For instance, in qualitative research on personal identity, researchers ensure the richness and depth of data through in-depth interviews and case analysis, thus supporting the coherence of research conclusions.\n\nThe evaluation criteria for coherence in psychological research include internal consistency and external consistency. Internal consistency requires that all parts of the research logically support each other without contradiction. External consistency emphasizes the replicability and generalizability of research results across different contexts and samples. For example, in the study of coherent experience reconstruction, researchers ensure the stability and consistency of research results across different individuals and contexts through multiple rounds of interviews and cross-case analysis.\n\nThe application of coherence in psychological research also involves identifying and selecting correct theories. Researchers need to ensure that the chosen theory can explain research data through systematic theoretical comparison and empirical testing, while avoiding theories that are logically contradictory or inconsistent with existing evidence. For example, in exploring error correction and theory selection, researchers compare the predictive and explanatory power of different theoretical models to ultimately choose the theory that best fits the research data, thereby ensuring the coherence of the research.\nThe application of coherence in philosophy to personal identity involves reconstructing individual experiences coherently to achieve an understanding of the continuity and consistency of personal identity. This reconstruction focuses not only on internal psychological and cognitive processes but also on the influence of social and cultural environments on individual identity.\n\nIn the construction of management theories, coherence is reflected through three perspectives of logical reasoning: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. These reasoning methods ensure the internal consistency and external validity of theories, thereby providing reliable guidance for management practices. Coherence here is not only about the internal logical consistency of the theory but also its alignment with practical experience.\n\nThe self-expression and place significance interpretation of Lhasa drifters demonstrate the specific application of coherence in local cultural studies. The study analyzes the self-expression and place significance construction of the drifter group, revealing the interactive relationship between individual behavior and local culture. This interactive relationship's coherence not only manifests in individuals' identification and adaptation to local culture but also in the norms and shaping of individual behavior by local culture.\nInterdisciplinary research management needs to consider multiple factors, including project management, funding allocation, and evaluation mechanisms. The National Natural Science Foundation emphasizes the flexibility of project management and the reasonable allocation of funds to promote effective cooperation and resource sharing among different disciplines.\n\nTheoretical review articles point out that the evaluation criteria for interdisciplinary research should include scientific rigor, innovation, and practicality. Scientific rigor ensures the rigor of research methods and conclusions, innovation emphasizes breakthroughs in theory and methodology, and practicality focuses on the practical value and impact of research results.\n\nThe construction of textbook evaluation standards provides a reference for the comprehensive evaluation of interdisciplinary research. The functions, paths, and prospects of textbook evaluation cover comprehensiveness of content, scientific rigor of methods, and contributions to disciplinary development. These standards are equally applicable to the evaluation of interdisciplinary research, helping to ensure the systematicness and sustainability of research.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Self-consistency in theory building is manifested as logical consistency and the integrity of internal structure, ensuring that the theory remains consistent across different levels and applications. For example, the application of the ChatGPT model in the filing review of normative documents ensures consistency and accuracy in text processing through self-consistency, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of the review.\n\nSelf-consistency is demonstrated through verification and testing in practical applications, ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of the theory. For instance, the performance of the ChatGPT model in actual review tasks has been proven through multiple verifications and tests, demonstrating its consistency and stability in handling complex texts and legal documents, thus enhancing its credibility in practical applications.\n\nSelf-consistency plays a crucial role in the evolution of theories, driving continuous optimization and improvement. For example, in the study of the semiotic significance of internet emoticons, self-consistency ensures the applicability and consistency of the theory across different cultural and social contexts, providing a solid foundation for the development of semiotics.\nData saturation is a key step in qualitative research to ensure data self-consistency, referring to the point in data collection where new data no longer provides new information or insights. A study in the Acta Psychologica Sinica points out that the criteria for determining data saturation include data repetition and thematic consistency, which helps ensure the reliability and validity of the research. Further research by the Institute of Psychology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences emphasizes the importance of achieving data saturation in qualitative research to avoid redundancy and waste of data.\n\nThere are significant differences in the application of self-consistency between qualitative and empirical research. Qualitative research explores individuals' or groups' experiences, feelings, and behaviors in depth, emphasizing the depth and richness of data, while empirical research verifies hypotheses through quantitative data and statistical analysis, emphasizing the breadth and precision of data. These two research methods have different focuses in achieving self-consistency: qualitative research ensures internal self-consistency through data saturation and thematic consistency, while empirical research ensures external self-consistency through sample representativeness, the reliability and validity of measurement tools, and statistical significance.\n\nIn the research paradigms of social sciences, the basic differences between qualitative and empirical research not only lie in methodology but also in research goals and theoretical frameworks. Qualitative research aims to understand the complexity and diversity of social phenomena, emphasizing in-depth descriptions and explanations of contexts, while empirical research aims to verify theoretical hypotheses and establish universal laws, emphasizing the quantitative analysis of variable relationships. Understanding these fundamental differences helps researchers make more informed decisions when choosing appropriate research methods, thereby enhancing the self-consistency and scientific nature of their research.\n\nThe application of self-consistency in personal identity emphasizes the internal consistency and logical coherence of individual experiences, which is crucial for building a stable self-identity. Through coherent experience reconstruction, individuals can integrate different life experiences and cognitions into a coherent narrative, thereby enhancing the stability and continuity of their self-identity.\n\nFoucault's methodological approach to neoliberalism in his later works focuses on the construction and maintenance of subjectivity, which is significant in the theory of personal identity. Foucault argues that individuals can achieve self-shaping within the constraints of social structures through self-discipline and self-management, a process that reflects the dynamic role of self-consistency in personal identity.\n\nIn management theory, self-consistency is used to explain the adaptation and decision-making processes of organizations and individuals in complex environments. By integrating personal identity with organizational goals and culture, managers can promote employees' self-identification and organizational commitment, thereby enhancing organizational cohesion and performance.\n\nThe key to interdisciplinary research lies in integrating knowledge from different fields rather than simply breaking down disciplines. For example, in the study of early identification methods for disruptive technologies, a framework was developed from a scientific perspective, integrating methods from technology forecasting, scientometrics, and policy analysis, providing systematic theoretical and practical guidance for technology innovation management. This interdisciplinary integration method can more comprehensively identify and evaluate potential disruptive technologies, offering new perspectives and tools for project management and comprehensive evaluation.\n\nIn management academic research, the integration of Drucker's and March's ideas proposes a 'unified knowledge and action' management approach. Drucker emphasizes goal management and self-control, while March focuses on organizational learning and decision-making processes. By combining these two theories, a more comprehensive management framework can be formed, not only focusing on efficiency and goal achievement but also emphasizing the continuous learning and adaptability of organizations. This integration provides a richer and multi-dimensional theoretical foundation for project management and comprehensive evaluation, helping to enhance the scientific nature and effectiveness of management practices.\n\nThe application of interdisciplinary research in project management and comprehensive evaluation requires establishing a self-consistent system method. Self-consistency means establishing consistency and coordination among different disciplines, ensuring that the theories and methods of each discipline can seamlessly connect. For example, in project management, a self-consistent method can ensure the coordination and consistency of various aspects such as technology forecasting, risk management, cost control, and time management, thereby improving the overall performance and success rate of the project. Self-consistency not only enhances the internal consistency of the project but also enhances its adaptability to changes in the external environment.</learnings>\n"

For example, Hu Yesheng mentioned in a blog post on ScienceNet that through concept extraction and rational refinement, information technology can be effectively applied to English teaching, improving teaching effectiveness and student engagement.\n\nCoherence in theoretical construction ensures internal consistency and external validity in linguistic research. Specific case analyses show that well-designed and rigorously argued coherent theories can better guide teaching practices, avoiding disconnection between theory and practical application.\n\nThe actual effects of coherence in application can be verified through specific cases. The common questions section of the China Association for Comparative Studies of English and Chinese (CACSCE) mentions several successful cases that demonstrate the important role of coherence in combining theory with practice, such as improving teaching methods through information technology means to enhance students' language skills.\nIn qualitative research, coherence emphasizes the importance of narrative structure, but interviews can easily fall into preset narrative patterns, leading to data bias and distortion. Zhao Dingxin pointed out in discussing mechanism explanation that while qualitative research can provide in-depth case analysis, its limitation lies in the difficulty of generalizing to larger samples or broader contexts, which limits its application in empirical research.\n\nAchieving coherence in qualitative research requires going beyond single interview data and combining multiple data sources and methods, such as observation and literature analysis, to enhance the reliability and validity of the research. This integration of multiple methods can effectively avoid biases from a single data source, enhancing the overall coherence of the research.\n\nZhao Dingxin further noted that although qualitative research has unique advantages in case analysis, in empirical research, quantitative data and statistical analysis can provide broader validation and generalization. Therefore, combining qualitative and quantitative research can better balance depth and breadth, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the research.\n\nThe practical effect of coherence in philosophy, particularly in personal identity, is reflected in the consistency analysis of individual behavior and beliefs, revealing the internal logic in moral decision-making. This coherence not only affects an individual's self-awareness but may also influence their behavior patterns in society, such as in altruistic behavior.\n\nIn management theory, the importance of coherence is evident in organizational culture and decision-making processes. An organization that maintains consistency in its values, mission, and actual operations can enhance employee belonging and loyalty, thereby improving overall organizational performance. Conversely, organizations lacking coherence may experience internal conflicts and inefficiency.\n\nThe application of coherence in ethics, especially in meta-ethics concerning 'intuition,' shows that individual and collective moral judgments often rely on internal consistency and logic. This intuition plays a crucial role not only in personal ethical decisions but also in the ethical frameworks of organizations and institutions, ensuring the reasonableness and fairness of decisions.\n\nIn interdisciplinary research, the practical effect of coherence in project management and comprehensive evaluation is demonstrated by integrating theories and methods from different disciplines, which can improve the systematic and scientific nature of project management, better addressing complexity and uncertainty. For example, interdisciplinary teams in project management can more effectively identify and resolve potential issues, increasing the success rate of projects.\n\nThe application of coherence in interdisciplinary research is not limited to the theoretical level but also manifests in practical operations. By building interdisciplinary teams, project management can better integrate resources, optimize processes, and improve efficiency. For instance, a survey report on interdisciplinary research indicates that interdisciplinary teams can more quickly adapt to environmental changes during project execution, enhancing the accuracy and timeliness of decision-making.\n\nCoherence in interdisciplinary research is also reflected in the establishment of evaluation systems. By integrating evaluation standards and methods from different disciplines, a more comprehensive and scientific evaluation system can be constructed, providing more accurate assessments of project performance and impact. For example, interdisciplinary research teams in project evaluation can consider social, economic, and environmental dimensions comprehensively, offering more holistic evaluation results.</learnings>\n"

The progress of the eukaryotic cell through the cycle is controlled by cell cycle checkpoints. Progression through checkpoints is controlled through complex interactions between various proteins, including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Unlike bacteria, eukaryotic DNA replicates in the confines of the nucleus. The G1/S checkpoint (or restriction checkpoint) regulates whether eukaryotic cells enter the process of DNA replication and subsequent division. Cells that do not proceed through this checkpoint remain in the G0 stage and do not replicate their DNA. Replication of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes occurs\nDoc 2(Title: \"Eukaryotic DNA replication\") Eukaryotic DNA replication is a conserved mechanism that restricts DNA replication to once per cell cycle. Eukaryotic DNA replication of chromosomal DNA is central for the duplication of a cell and is necessary for the maintenance of the eukaryotic genome. DNA replication is the action of DNA polymerases synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to the original template strand. To synthesize DNA, the double-stranded DNA is unwound by DNA helicases ahead of polymerases, forming a replication fork containing two single-stranded templates. Replication processes permit the copying of a single DNA double helix into two DNA helices, which are\nDoc 3(Title: \"Replication timing\") Replication timing refers to the order in which segments of DNA along the length of a chromosome are duplicated. In eukaryotic cells (cells that package their DNA within a nucleus), chromosomes consist of very long linear double-stranded DNA molecules. During the S-phase of each cell cycle (Figure 1), all of the DNA in a cell is duplicated in order to provide one copy to each of the daughter cells after the next cell division.

A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form.

Through this framework, a better understanding of how information is transmitted among users and how to design more effective information dissemination strategies can be achieved.\n\nThe theory of mind decryption reveals the path for enhancing collective wisdom from human society to artificial intelligence, emphasizing the importance of cognitive models in collective intelligence. This theory not only explains the formation mechanism of collective wisdom in human society but also explores how similar wisdom enhancement can be achieved in AI systems.\n\nResearch on collective intelligence goes beyond theoretical levels and involves practical applications, such as optimizing social media platforms and improving AI systems. These applications demonstrate the significant potential of collective intelligence in enhancing the efficiency of information dissemination and decision-making quality.\nIndividual intelligence and collective intelligence play different roles in a smart society. Individual intelligence emphasizes an individual's capabilities in information processing, decision-making, and problem-solving, while collective intelligence focuses on group collaboration and the generation of shared wisdom. The advantage of individual intelligence lies in providing diverse perspectives and innovative solutions, which are particularly important in complex problems.\n\nThe application of individual intelligence in intelligent agents showcases strong adaptability and flexibility. Whether physical robots or software agents, intelligent agents can autonomously learn and optimize their behaviors to adapt to changing environments and task requirements. This capability makes intelligent agents significantly advantageous in fields such as automation, complex system management, and personalized services.\n\nCollective adaptability, an advanced development of collective intelligence, not only focuses on the wisdom of the group but also emphasizes the learning and adaptation capabilities of the group in dynamic environments. Through collective adaptability, groups can more effectively address complex and changing challenges, achieving higher levels of collaboration and innovation, thus having a profound impact in social, economic, and technological fields.\nIn the process of group decision-making, even if each member is intelligent, irrational decisions may still be made due to limitations in information processing, communication barriers, and group pressure. This phenomenon is particularly common in large organizations and complex projects, where information asymmetry and power structure issues further amplify these negative effects.\n\nThe 'groupthink' phenomenon exists in group decision-making, where members tend to suppress dissenting opinions to maintain group harmony and avoid conflict. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and innovation in the decision-making process. This phenomenon is especially evident in highly homogeneous groups, where the similarity among members makes it harder to propose different viewpoints, thereby reducing the quality of decisions.\n\nThe efficiency of group decision-making is also a significant aspect. The decision-making process often takes longer than individual decision-making, especially when coordinating multiple stakeholders and handling large amounts of information. Additionally, group decision-making may suffer from responsibility diffusion, leading to ineffective implementation of decisions, specifically manifested by a lack of clear accountability in the follow-up and execution stages, affecting the effectiveness of decisions.\nThe theoretical framework of collective intelligence provides new perspectives for the dissemination of information on social media. Scientists have optimized the flow and distribution of information through these frameworks, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of information dissemination. Advanced reviews mention that the application of deep learning technology in collective intelligence has not only enhanced algorithm performance but also promoted interdisciplinary research integration, such as in sociology, psychology, and computer science. Research on the theory of mind decryption shows that the path to enhancing collective wisdom from human society to AI involves multi-level interactions and collaborations, including the optimization of individual intelligence, improvement of group decision-making, and optimization of social network structures. These factors collectively drive the development of collective intelligence.\nPsychological and sociological studies show that collective intelligence can surpass individual intelligence in the decision-making process by integrating diverse perspectives and information, enabling groups to solve problems more accurately and make better decisions. The effectiveness of collective intelligence depends on communication and collaboration among group members, as well as the inclusion and respect for different opinions, which is particularly important in complex and uncertain environments.\n\nCollective adaptability is an important aspect of collective intelligence, emphasizing the ability of groups to quickly adjust and optimize decision-making strategies when facing changes and challenges. This adaptability relies not only on individual flexibility but also on the internal structure and mechanisms of the group, such as information sharing, feedback loops, and transparency in decision-making processes, which collectively promote the efficiency and continuous improvement of the group.\n\nInterdisciplinary research has revealed the application potential of collective intelligence in various fields, such as business management, public policy formulation, and social innovation. Research by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences points out that through interdisciplinary cooperation, a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and impacts of collective intelligence can be achieved, providing scientific basis and practical guidance for actual applications, such as using collective intelligence to improve decision-making efficiency and effectiveness in crisis management.</learnings>\n"

For instance, research on collective intelligence in deep learning has shown that by designing reasonable reward mechanisms and goal settings, the performance of multi-agent systems can be significantly improved, enabling efficient solutions to complex tasks. This mechanism has been proven effective in practical projects, such as distributed sensor networks and autonomous vehicle fleets.\n\nIn failed cases, the implementation of collective intelligence is often constrained by data quality and algorithm selection. For example, if the data quality is low or the algorithms are improperly chosen, even with good collaboration mechanisms, collective intelligence cannot function as intended. This has been verified in multiple practical projects, such as some intelligent transportation systems failing to meet expectations due to inaccurate data collection or unsuitable algorithm models.\nGroup decision-making in corporate management and public policy may suffer from decreased decision quality due to information asymmetry and communication barriers. Information asymmetry means that some members have more critical information, while communication barriers can prevent important information from being effectively conveyed, thus affecting the accuracy and timeliness of decisions.\n\nUneven distribution of power and interests in group decision-making can lead to decisions favoring specific interest groups. Such imbalances not only affect the fairness of decisions but can also trigger internal conflicts, weakening organizational cohesion and execution.\n\nHerd mentality and groupthink phenomena in group decision-making processes can lead to a lack of innovation and critical thinking. Herd mentality makes individuals tend to follow the majority opinion, while groupthink can cause teams to ignore potential risks and alternative solutions, thereby affecting the innovativeness and scientific nature of decisions.\nPsychology and sociology, although they have overlapping research areas, focus on different aspects. Psychology focuses more on individual psychological processes and behaviors, while sociology emphasizes social structures, social relationships, and group behaviors. For example, psychological research might explore how individuals' psychological changes under group pressure, while sociology might analyze how this pressure is generated and spread in different social structures.\n\nA book review of 'Social Psychology' points out that as an interdisciplinary field, social psychology delves into the complex relationship between human behavior and social influence. The book reveals through empirical research and theoretical analysis the profound impact of groupthink and group pressure on individual behavior, such as conformist behavior, social identity, and group polarization.\n\nStudies over half a century have shown that social changes have had a significant impact on the psychology and behavior of Chinese people. Research findings indicate that with the development of the social economy and cultural environment, the values, social attitudes, and behavioral patterns of Chinese people have changed significantly, further influencing the formation mechanisms of group thinking and group pressure.\nThe ant colony optimization algorithm in swarm intelligence can effectively solve complex problems, such as path planning and resource allocation. By simulating the foraging behavior of ants, the ant colony optimization algorithm uses positive feedback mechanisms to gradually optimize solutions, ultimately finding the global optimum. For example, in logistics distribution, the ant colony optimization algorithm can significantly reduce delivery time and costs, improving overall efficiency.\n\nThe research team led by Li Aiming at the School of Engineering proposed an effective mechanism for updating intelligent individual game strategies in complex systems. This mechanism, by simulating interactions and learning processes among individuals, enhances their adaptability and decision-making capabilities in complex environments. Specifically, this mechanism allows individuals to dynamically adjust their strategies based on environmental feedback, maintaining competitiveness in dynamic environments. This mechanism has broad application prospects in multi-agent systems, especially in scenarios requiring rapid response and adaptation.\n\nThe advantages of agents in solving complex problems are not only reflected at the algorithmic level but also in the flexibility and robustness of practical applications. For example, in intelligent transportation systems, agents can real-time analyze and process large amounts of traffic data, predict traffic flow, and optimize signal control strategies, significantly reducing traffic congestion and improving road capacity. This not only enhances the overall efficiency of urban transportation systems but also improves residents' travel experience.\nCollective adaptability has shown significant effects in climate change governance on the Inner Mongolia grasslands.

The debate has sparked new discussions at the Conference on Data Ethics (CODE), where stakeholders from various sectors are advocating for clearer regulations and frameworks to govern data ownership and usage. These frameworks aim to address the complexities of data governance, including the ethical implications of data collection, processing, and sharing, particularly in the context of emerging technologies like AI and IoT.\n\nThe BSA TechPost outlines a vision for data privacy from the present to 2030, underscoring the importance of international cooperation and harmonization of data protection laws. Key recommendations include the development of interoperable privacy standards and the establishment of cross-border mechanisms to facilitate data flows while maintaining robust privacy protections. This approach seeks to balance the economic benefits of data utilization with the need to protect individuals' personal information and prevent misuse.\n\nRecent research also emphasizes the role of technology in enhancing data privacy, suggesting that advanced encryption, differential privacy, and other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) can play a crucial role in mitigating risks. These technologies are seen as essential tools for organizations to comply with stringent privacy regulations and build trust with consumers, thereby fostering a more sustainable digital economy. The adoption of such technologies is increasingly being viewed as a strategic imperative, not just a regulatory requirement.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce emphasizes the importance of aligning data utilization practices with existing privacy laws and guidance, highlighting the need for organizations to establish clear policies that address data collection, storage, and sharing to ensure compliance and mitigate legal risks.\n\nIdentification for Development initiatives focus on the integration of data protection principles in the design and implementation of identification systems, particularly in developing countries, where the lack of robust data protection frameworks can lead to significant privacy vulnerabilities and potential misuse of personal data.\n\nKey elements to include in a data protection policy, as outlined in best practices, encompass a comprehensive approach to data governance, including data minimization, purpose limitation, transparency, and accountability mechanisms, ensuring that organizations not only comply with legal requirements but also build trust with data subjects through proactive and transparent data handling practices.\nData protection measures, such as GDPR and CCPA, have significantly influenced the pace and direction of technological innovation, leading companies to invest more in secure data integration and management systems, which in turn has spurred the development of new privacy-centric technologies and services.\n\nThe rise of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and differential privacy methods has enabled organizations to utilize data more effectively while maintaining user privacy, fostering a new wave of innovation in data analytics and machine learning that balances utility and confidentiality.\n\nEmerging trends in data privacy, such as the increasing adoption of zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, are reshaping the landscape of data utilization by providing robust solutions that allow for secure data sharing and collaboration, thereby accelerating technological advancements in sectors like healthcare and finance.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) both emphasize the importance of data subject rights, including the right to access, delete, and opt-out of the sale of personal data, but differ in their scope and enforcement mechanisms. GDPR applies to any organization processing personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where the organization is based, and imposes strict fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher, for non-compliance. In contrast, CCPA applies to businesses operating in California that meet certain thresholds and imposes fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation, focusing more on consumer opt-out rights and data sale restrictions.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States specifically targets the protection of sensitive patient health information and applies to healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, imposing civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. Unlike GDPR and CCPA, HIPAA does not provide a private right of action for individuals, meaning that enforcement is primarily handled by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nThe Australian Privacy Principles (APP) and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) share commonalities with GDPR in terms of requiring organizations to obtain informed consent for data collection and usage, but they differ in their regulatory frameworks and enforcement powers. APP is enforced by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and allows for fines of up to AUD 2.1 million for serious or repeated breaches, while PIPEDA is enforced by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) and does not have direct fines but can recommend penalties and publicize non-compliance, which can damage an organization's reputation.\nOrganizations like Atlan have successfully balanced data utilization and privacy by implementing a robust data governance framework that includes data lineage, access controls, and regular audits. This approach ensures that data is used ethically and securely, enhancing trust among stakeholders and reducing the risk of data breaches.\n\nSmartDev's case study on AI and data privacy highlights the importance of transparent and explainable AI models. By using techniques such as differential privacy and federated learning, SmartDev has been able to develop AI systems that protect user data while still providing valuable insights. This strategy not only complies with regulatory requirements but also builds user confidence in AI technologies.\n\nThe Business Case for Privacy demonstrates that companies can turn data privacy into a profit center by integrating privacy by design principles into their product development processes. For example, companies like Apple and Microsoft have seen increased market share and customer loyalty by prioritizing privacy. By embedding privacy features from the outset, these organizations have reduced the costs associated with data breaches and enhanced their brand reputation.\nThe implementation of GDPR and CCPA has led to the development of innovative privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) in healthcare and finance, such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption, which allow data to be used for analytics and machine learning while maintaining individual privacy. These technologies have been adopted by major companies like Apple and Microsoft, with Apple incorporating differential privacy in its iOS operating system to protect user data while collecting usage statistics.\n\nIn the healthcare sector, GDPR and CCPA have spurred the creation of more robust data anonymization techniques and secure data sharing frameworks, which have improved the interoperability of health information systems. For example, the European Health Data Space (EHDS) initiative aims to create a secure and standardized infrastructure for sharing health data across the EU, enhancing cross-border healthcare and research collaborations.\n\nThe financial sector has seen a significant increase in the adoption of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to comply with data protection regulations, particularly in areas like transaction transparency and auditability. Companies like JPMorgan have developed blockchain solutions like Quorum to ensure compliance with GDPR and CCPA, enabling secure and transparent data management while reducing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance penalties.\nEmerging PETs such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and homomorphic encryption (HE) are gaining significant traction due to their ability to enable data utilization and innovation while preserving privacy. ZKPs allow for the verification of information without revealing the information itself, making them ideal for applications in identity verification, secure communications, and blockchain transactions. HE, on the other hand, enables computations on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first, which is particularly useful in cloud computing and data outsourcing scenarios, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity throughout the processing pipeline.\n\nGlobal support for privacy-enhancing technologies is on the rise, with governments and regulatory bodies increasingly recognizing the importance of PETs in fostering a robust and secure digital ecosystem. This support manifests in the form of funding initiatives, policy frameworks, and collaborative research projects aimed at advancing PETs. For example, the European Union has launched several programs to support the development and deployment of PETs, recognizing their potential to enhance data protection and trust in digital services.\n\nThe practical applications of PETs are expanding across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and telecommunications.

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The core goal of knowledge distillation is to transfer the knowledge from a large and complex model (teacher model) to a small and simple model (student model) to reduce computational resource consumption and improve deployment efficiency. The teacher model usually outperforms the student model in terms of performance but has high computational costs, while the student model maintains high accuracy with lower computational costs and faster inference speeds.\n\nKnowledge distillation guides the learning of the student model by introducing soft labels (i.e., the output probability distribution of the teacher model) during training, rather than relying solely on hard labels (i.e., true labels). These soft labels contain more information, helping the student model better capture the complex features of the data, thus performing better in various tasks.\n\nIn the process of knowledge distillation, the temperature parameter (Temperature) is used to adjust the smoothness of the soft labels produced by the teacher model. A higher temperature value makes the output probability distribution smoother, thereby passing more information to the student model; a lower temperature value makes the output closer to hard labels, reducing the amount of information. The choice of the temperature parameter significantly affects the effectiveness of knowledge distillation and needs to be optimized based on specific tasks.\nLarge models excel in handling complex tasks, capturing deeper features and patterns, and are suitable for scenarios requiring high precision and complex reasoning, such as natural language understanding and image recognition. However, the training and inference costs of large models are high, requiring substantial computational resources and data support, and their deployment and operational efficiency is lower in resource-constrained environments.\n\nSmall models, although not as effective as large models in complex tasks, have significant advantages in resource-constrained and high-real-time requirement scenarios, such as embedded devices and mobile applications. Small models have faster training and inference speeds, consume less computational resources and memory, and are easier to deploy and run on edge devices, performing well in low-power environments.\n\nThe choice of model size should be balanced based on specific application scenarios and resource constraints. Large models are suitable for high-performance computing environments and tasks with high precision requirements, while small models are appropriate for resource-constrained and high-real-time requirement scenarios. By using techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and distillation, the performance gap between large and small models can be reduced to some extent, enabling more efficient model deployment and application.\nThe integration of distillation and pruning optimization strategies can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of models. By combining distillation and pruning techniques, it is possible to maintain model accuracy while drastically reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. This optimization strategy has important practical value in real-world applications, especially in resource-constrained edge devices.\n\nThe application of distillation techniques in large-scale models can effectively enhance the performance of small models. By transferring knowledge from large models to small models, distillation techniques can enable small models to achieve performance close to that of large models during inference, while significantly reducing computational costs and deployment difficulties. This technology has been widely applied and validated in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision.\n\nThe selection and adjustment of optimization strategies during the distillation process have a significant impact on the final results. Different distillation strategies, such as temperature adjustment, knowledge type selection, and loss function design, all affect the effectiveness of distillation. Therefore, choosing the appropriate distillation strategy for specific tasks and application scenarios is key to optimizing model performance.\nDeepSeek successfully extracted knowledge from weaker large models using large model distillation techniques, creating more efficient and higher-performing small models, which has attracted significant attention in the AI field.\n\nThrough large model distillation, DeepSeek not only improved the performance of small models but also significantly reduced the demand for computational resources, making it possible to deploy high-performance AI models in resource-constrained environments.\n\nDeepSeek's large model distillation technology has demonstrated strong potential in practical applications, such as in natural language processing tasks, where distilled small models have achieved performance comparable to or even better than large models in multiple benchmark tests, providing new ideas for AI model optimization and deployment.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>'Knowledge distillation is a key technology for effectively transferring the knowledge of large models to smaller models. By training smaller models to mimic the outputs of larger models, it is possible to maintain high performance while significantly reducing model complexity and computational resource requirements. This method not only accelerates the inference speed of models but also improves the deployment efficiency of smaller models in resource-constrained environments.\n\nDuring the process of 'rebirth' and 'nourishment' between large and small models, smaller models can use techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning to leverage the pre-trained weights and feature representations of larger models, further enhancing their own performance. This collaborative mechanism allows smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger models on specific tasks while maintaining lower resource consumption.\n\nIn the era of large models, the role of smaller models is not just to serve as lightweight alternatives; they can also be integrated with large models through techniques like ensemble learning and multimodal fusion to build complex AI systems. This complementary relationship enables smaller models to play unique roles in specific scenarios, such as edge computing and mobile devices, while working synergistically with larger models to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the overall system.\nDistillation technology can effectively transfer the knowledge of large models to smaller models, thereby maintaining high performance while significantly reducing computational and storage costs. For example, DeepSeek's distillation technology successfully transferred the inference capabilities of large models to smaller models through a specific distillation fine-tuning paradigm, achieving efficient application in resource-constrained environments.\n\nThe advantages of large models in inference can be retained through distillation technology, while smaller models exhibit higher flexibility and adaptability in practical applications. In specific instances, DeepSeek's distillation technology not only improved the accuracy of smaller models but also achieved performance comparable to large models in multiple benchmark tests, demonstrating the effectiveness of distillation technology.\n\nIn practical applications, distillation technology focuses not only on improving model performance but also on enhancing model interpretability and robustness. By optimizing the distillation process of large models, smaller models not only perform well on specific tasks but also show stronger adaptability in complex and dynamic environments, which is crucial for actual deployment and long-term maintenance.\nThe key to model distillation lies in selecting appropriate teacher and student models. The teacher model should have high accuracy and complexity, while the student model should have high efficiency and low resource consumption. Adjusting the distillation temperature (Temperature Scaling) can optimize the knowledge transfer effect; a higher temperature can make the output probability distribution of the teacher model smoother, helping the student model better learn the knowledge of the teacher model.\n\nDuring the distillation process, the design of the loss function is critical. Common distillation loss functions include Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). By combining the loss function of the original task, more effective knowledge transfer can be achieved. Additionally, the selection of data during the distillation process is important; using diverse and representative datasets can improve the generalization ability of the student model.\n\nAdjusting distillation parameters needs to be done based on specific tasks and models. Commonly adjusted parameters include learning rate, batch size, and distillation temperature. Dynamically adjusting these parameters, such as using a higher learning rate and temperature in the early stages of training and gradually lowering them as training progresses, can significantly enhance the distillation effect.\nOne of the main challenges faced by distillation technology in practical applications is the issue of performance loss. Although distillation can reduce model complexity and computational costs, in some cases, the performance of the distilled model may be significantly lower than that of the original large model. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various methods, such as using more complex distillation loss functions, introducing auxiliary tasks, and multi-stage distillation strategies, to improve the performance of distilled models.\n\nAnother challenge is the efficiency and completeness of knowledge transfer. During the distillation process, how to effectively transfer the knowledge of large models to smaller models, especially for complex tasks and datasets, is a difficult problem. Solutions include using soft labels, intermediate layer feature alignment, and combining self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge transfer.\n\nDistillation technology also faces data privacy and security issues in practical applications. Especially in sensitive fields such as healthcare and finance, data privacy protection is crucial. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed methods such as differential privacy distillation, federated learning distillation, and secure multi-party computation, which can protect data privacy while achieving effective model distillation.'</learnings>\n"

Knowledge distillation guides the learning process of smaller models by using the outputs of larger models as soft labels, thereby enhancing their performance. Transfer learning improves the performance of weaker models on specific tasks by fine-tuning pre-trained models.\n\nThe provision of effective knowledge by weaker large models relies on data augmentation and regularization techniques. Data augmentation increases the model's generalization ability and reduces overfitting by generating more training samples. Regularization techniques such as Dropout and L2 regularization prevent overfitting by limiting the complexity of the model, ensuring more stable performance on new data.\n\nDuring inference, weaker large models utilize sparse activation and pruning techniques to improve computational efficiency and resource utilization. Sparse activation reduces computation by selectively activating neurons, speeding up inference. Model pruning optimizes the model structure by removing redundant neurons and connections, further reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance.\nDistillation technology has been successfully applied in DeepSeek to transfer the performance of large language models to smaller models. Specific cases show that through distillation, small models can outperform their larger teacher models on specific tasks. For example, DeepSeek's small model improved BLEU scores by 2.5% in machine translation tasks while reducing model size by 75%.\n\nIn the quantized distillation process, the introduction of quantization techniques further optimized the model's performance and efficiency. Specific examples demonstrate that the quantized distillation model increased inference speed by 40% and reduced resource consumption by 50%, providing a feasible solution for deploying efficient models in resource-constrained environments.\n\nPerformance comparisons between models of different sizes show that distillation not only enhances the performance of small models but also significantly reduces model complexity while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, one study found that a large model with 1 billion parameters was successfully compressed into a small model with 10 million parameters, with only a 1% drop in performance across multiple benchmarks, indicating the significant potential of distillation in model compression and performance optimization.\nThe temperature parameter has a significant impact on distillation effectiveness. Higher temperatures smooth the probability distribution, making the model focus more on hard-to-classify samples, thus improving the generalization ability of distillation. The selection of the temperature parameter needs to be tuned based on specific tasks and datasets, typically determined by validation set performance.\n\nThe choice and design of loss functions are crucial for distillation results. Commonly used loss functions include KL divergence, mean squared error, and cross-entropy. Different loss functions perform differently in various scenarios; for example, KL divergence works well for aligning soft labels, while mean squared error is more suitable for regression tasks. Combining weighted combinations of multiple loss functions can further enhance distillation effects.\n\nHyperparameter tuning in the distillation process requires a comprehensive consideration of model performance and computational resources, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. Appropriate hyperparameter configurations can significantly improve distillation efficiency and the final model's performance. It is recommended to use methods like grid search or random search for systematic tuning.\nPrivacy-enhancing computation (PEC) technologies play a critical role in protecting data privacy. Techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy ensure that data remains confidential during processing and analysis while maintaining usability and computational efficiency. These technologies are increasingly applied in sensitive industries like finance, healthcare, and government, effectively addressing challenges related to data privacy and security.\n\nBlockchain-based federated learning (FL) enables distributed model training without sharing raw data, effectively solving issues of data silos and privacy protection. The introduction of blockchain technology further enhances the transparency and security of federated learning, ensuring the immutability and traceability of data during the model training process, providing reliable technical support for cross-institutional collaboration.\n\nPerformance loss is one of the main challenges in applying privacy protection technologies, especially in large-scale data processing and real-time analysis scenarios. By optimizing algorithms and computational architectures, such as using hardware accelerators (like GPUs and TPUs) and distributed computing frameworks (like Spark and Flink), computational efficiency can be significantly improved, reducing performance loss and ensuring the feasibility and effectiveness of privacy protection technologies in practical applications.</learnings>\n"

Specific methods include setting a norm threshold for gradients; when the gradient norm exceeds this threshold, the gradients are scaled down proportionally to avoid large weight updates that could degrade model performance.\nDeepSeek's quantization distillation technology successfully compressed a 13B parameter large model to 1.3B parameters, achieving a 5x inference speedup and significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of the model in industrial applications.\n\nDeepSeek's distillation technology not only focuses on reducing model parameters but also optimizes computational efficiency through quantization methods, ensuring high performance even in resource-constrained environments.\n\nDeepSeek's technical community provides detailed practical guides to help developers and engineers fully understand the application of distillation technology from theory to practice, including specific steps, tools, and best practices.\nOptimizing the temperature parameter during distillation can significantly improve model performance. By adjusting the temperature parameter, the probability distribution of the teacher model's output can be controlled, influencing the learning process of the student model. A higher temperature makes the distribution smoother, helping the student model capture broader features, while a lower temperature makes the distribution sharper, aiding the student model in learning more specific features.\n\nThe choice and adjustment of loss functions are crucial for distillation effectiveness. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy loss, each suitable for different tasks and models. For instance, Cross-Entropy loss performs well in classification tasks, while MSE is more applicable in regression tasks. Combining multiple loss functions can further optimize distillation results.\n\nHyperparameter tuning is a key step in the distillation process and can be performed using methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, and temperature parameter, and optimizing these can significantly enhance the performance of the student model. For example, an appropriate learning rate can accelerate model convergence, while a suitable batch size can balance computational efficiency and model performance.\nPrivacy-preserving technologies like homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy face significant performance challenges in practical applications. These techniques have high computational complexity, leading to inefficiency in large-scale data processing, especially in scenarios requiring real-time and low-latency performance. For instance, the encryption and decryption processes of homomorphic encryption are very time-consuming, making it difficult to implement in high-throughput applications. To address this issue, researchers are exploring hardware acceleration techniques, such as using specialized encryption chips and FPGAs, to increase computational speed and reduce latency.\n\nSecure multi-party computation faces the main challenge of trust among participants. In multi-party computation, participants need to collaborate but cannot fully trust each other, leading to complex security protocols and additional communication overhead. Moreover, when the number of participants is large, the complexity of the protocol and communication costs increase significantly. To address this issue, some research proposes using blockchain technology to enhance trust mechanisms, recording and verifying the computation process through a distributed ledger to ensure data integrity and non-repudiation.\n\nDifferential privacy faces the main challenge of balancing privacy protection and data utility. Differential privacy protects individual privacy by adding noise, but excessive noise levels can severely impact data accuracy and the reliability of analysis results. For example, in medical data analysis, excessive noise can lead to misdiagnosis. To address this issue, researchers are developing adaptive noise addition algorithms that dynamically adjust noise levels based on data sensitivity and application scenarios, maximizing data utility while protecting privacy.</learnings>\n"

During this period, several major environmental incidents, such as the Meuse River pollution event in Belgium in 1970, heightened public concern about environmental protection, driving the emergence and development of the environmental movement.\n\nIn the 1980s, European environmental policies began to become systematic and institutionalized. After the establishment of the EU, environmental policy became one of its core issues. In 1987, the EU adopted its first Environmental Action Plan, setting goals for pollution prevention, natural resource protection, and sustainable development. Since then, the EU has continuously issued and updated environmental regulations, such as the 1992 'European Environmental Action Plan' and the 2000 'Environmental Quality Standards Directive.' These policies have provided legal and institutional guarantees for environmental protection in Europe.\n\nAnother important feature of the European environmental movement is the active participation of civil society. Since the 1970s, environmental organizations like Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have been established across Europe. These organizations have successfully pushed environmental issues onto the political agenda through protests, advocacy, and educational activities. The involvement of civil society has not only raised public awareness of environmental issues but also prompted governments and businesses to adopt more proactive environmental measures.\n\nThe rise of the green wave in Europe has been driven by multiple factors, including the urgency of climate change, increasing public concern about environmental issues, and the active participation of younger generations. These factors have collectively propelled the rise of green parties in many European countries, particularly in Germany, where the Green Party has become a significant force on the political stage.\n\nThe rise of the German Green Party stands out in a fragmented party landscape, reflecting voter dissatisfaction with traditional parties and a strong demand for more environmentally friendly policies. The success of the Green Party also lies in its effective use of social media and digital tools to mobilize supporters, leading to breakthroughs in elections.\n\nThere are significant differences in environmental attitudes among European countries, which are reflected not only in policy-making but also in cultural and social values. For example, Nordic countries like Sweden and Denmark are more proactive in their environmental policies, while Southern European countries like Italy and Greece lag behind. These differences reflect variations in economic development levels, political climates, and cultural backgrounds among different countries.\n\nSocioeconomic factors significantly support environmental policies in high-income countries and regions. These countries and regions not only have higher fiscal and technical capabilities but also possess strong social consensus and political will, driving the widespread implementation and effective enforcement of environmental policies. For instance, Germany and Nordic countries stand out in renewable energy and carbon reduction policies, which enjoy broad social support.\n\nSocioeconomic inequality and regional development disparities significantly impact the acceptance and effectiveness of environmental policies. In economically underdeveloped regions, environmental policies often face greater resistance because these areas rely more heavily on traditional industries and energy sectors, making the transition costs higher. For example, Poland and some Eastern European countries are hesitant about the EU's carbon neutrality targets, mainly due to their high reliance on coal in their energy mix, which poses significant economic and social challenges for the transition.\n\nPublic support for environmental policies is closely related to environmental awareness and education levels. In countries with widespread environmental education and high public environmental awareness, environmental policies are more likely to gain broad support. For example, countries like the Netherlands and Belgium have increased public acceptance and support for environmental policies through extensive environmental education and public participation programs, leading to significant improvements in the implementation of these policies.\n\nAt the core of EU environmental policy is the 'European Green Deal,' which comprehensively covers areas such as the circular economy, clean energy, and sustainable development, aiming to promote a green transition through a systemic policy framework. The 'European Green Deal' not only focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving resource efficiency but also emphasizes achieving sustainable development goals in economic and social aspects. For example, the policy promotes the widespread application of renewable energy, sets a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and supports these goals through investment and technological innovation.\n\nThe 'European Green Deal' proposes specific measures in the area of the circular economy, such as reducing waste generation, increasing material recycling rates, and promoting sustainable product design. These measures include legislative requirements for companies to adopt more environmentally friendly production methods, encouraging consumers to choose renewable and recyclable products, and establishing infrastructure related to the circular economy. Through these measures, the EU aims to increase resource productivity by 30% by 2030 and significantly reduce waste generation and disposal costs.\n\nThe 'European Green Deal' has made significant progress in the field of clean energy, particularly in the promotion of renewable energy and the improvement of energy efficiency standards. The EU has set a target of achieving a 32% share of renewable energy in energy consumption by 2030 and supports this goal through a series of policy and financial incentives. Additionally, the EU has strengthened energy efficiency standards in sectors such as buildings, transportation, and industry to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the EU's Building Energy Performance Directive requires all new buildings to meet nearly zero-energy standards from 2020.\n\nEurope's policies and actions on environmental issues are more proactive than those of other developed economies, primarily due to its historical and cultural background and a deep understanding and sense of urgency regarding climate change. The EU announced the 'European Green Agreement' in 2019, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which is more ambitious than the commitments of other developed economies such as the United States and Japan.\n\nEurope's environmental policies are supported by its internal political structure, with the EU's legislative and regulatory mechanisms playing a key role in driving member states to implement environmental initiatives. In contrast, environmental policies in other developed economies such as the United States and Japan are constrained by domestic political and economic interests, resulting in weaker policy implementation and effectiveness.\n\nThe maturity and influence of carbon trading markets in Europe far exceed those of other developed economies. The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), launched in 2005, has become the world's largest carbon trading market, effectively promoting the achievement of emission reduction targets. While other developed economies such as the United States and Japan also have carbon trading markets, they are much smaller and less influential compared to Europe.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The European Green Deal covers multiple aspects such as the circular economy, clean energy, and sustainable development, aiming to promote a comprehensive green transition. This policy framework not only focuses on reducing carbon emissions but also emphasizes efficient resource utilization and ecosystem protection to achieve sustainable economic and social development.\n\nThe actual effects of the EU's green transition still need further observation. Although the European Green Deal sets ambitious goals, its specific implementation outcomes and economic impacts are not yet clear. For example, key indicators such as the development of carbon trading markets, the adoption rate of clean energy, and the restructuring of related industries require long-term tracking and evaluation.\n\nThe impact of green transition policies on the economy and society is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, these policies promote innovation in green technology and the development of green industries, providing new drivers for economic growth; on the other hand, the transition process may lead to short-term economic costs and social issues, such as changes in employment structure and reduced industrial competitiveness, which require comprehensive measures to balance and address.\nEurope places more emphasis on legislation and regulation in environmental policies, using strict legal frameworks and standards to drive the achievement of emission reduction targets. For example, the EU has formulated the European Green Deal, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and set a target of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. This is more aggressive than the policies of the US and Japan, which rely more on market mechanisms and voluntary measures.\n\nUS environmental policies focus more on market incentives and technological innovation, promoting the development of clean energy and low-carbon technologies through tax incentives, subsidies, and research and development support. For example, the Biden administration's Clean Energy Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act include substantial fiscal incentives. In contrast, the policies of Europe and Japan rely more on regulations and standards.\n\nJapan's environmental policies emphasize improving energy efficiency and industrial transformation, achieving emission reduction targets through setting energy efficiency standards and promoting the application of green technologies. For example, the Japanese government launched the Green Growth Strategy, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 through improving energy efficiency and promoting new energy technologies. This strategy differs from those of Europe and the US, focusing more on technological progress and industrial transformation.\nThe European Green Deal aims to drive the transformation of the EU's economy and society to achieve its climate goals, but this transition faces multiple challenges, including insufficient funding, difficulties in policy coordination among member states, and slow technological innovation. Despite some progress, such as in renewable energy and energy efficiency, the EU has not yet reached its expected goals and has encountered many obstacles in implementation.\n\nThe pace of the EU's green agenda has slowed partly due to conflicts of interest and economic differences among member states. For example, Eastern European countries have a higher dependence on coal, while Western European countries are more advanced in renewable energy, leading to uneven policy implementation. Additionally, global economic uncertainties have exacerbated this issue, affecting the funding and technical support needed for the green transition.\n\nInsufficient funding is one of the main factors constraining the progress of the EU's green agenda. According to data from the European Investment Bank, achieving the 2030 climate targets requires at least 1 trillion euros in annual investment, but current investments fall far short of this level. The lack of funds not only affects infrastructure construction but also limits innovation and R&D activities, slowing down technological progress.\nThe rise of the Green Party in German elections, particularly in the 2021 federal election where it won 14.8% of the vote and became the third-largest party, is mainly attributed to its firm stance on environmental policies and social equity, as well as support from young voters. This rise has had a significant impact on Germany's political landscape, forcing traditional parties like the CDU/CSU and SPD to be more proactive on environmental issues.\n\nIn other European countries, the electoral performance and policy influence of the Green Party vary significantly. For example, in France, the Green Party won 13.47% of the vote in the 2019 European Parliament election, becoming the third-largest party, but performed poorly in subsequent domestic elections. In the Netherlands, the Green Party made significant progress in the 2017 general election, winning 14 seats and becoming the fourth-largest party, but saw a decline in the 2021 general election, winning only 8 seats.\n\nThe policy influence of the Green Party varies significantly across different countries, primarily due to differences in political culture and voter base. In Germany, the Green Party's policy proposals, such as climate protection and sustainable development, have received widespread support, driving the passage of several environmental laws. In other countries, such as Italy and Spain, the Green Party's influence is relatively limited, and its policy proposals struggle to gain majority support in parliament.\nEuropean civil society plays a crucial role in promoting air pollution control policies through strong grassroots movements and advocacy groups. For example, environmental organizations in Germany successfully pushed for stricter air pollution regulations through litigation and public campaigns, influencing both national and EU-level environmental policy-making.\n\nThe influence of European civil society on environmental policies extends beyond the legislative level to include monitoring and enforcement. For example, Greenpeace in the Netherlands ensures that governments and companies comply with environmental regulations through continuous environmental monitoring and public reporting, enhancing the transparency and effectiveness of policy implementation.\n\nThe multi-dimensional participation of European civil society, including education and community action, enhances public awareness and engagement in environmental issues. For example, the 'Friends of the Earth' organization in France promotes environmental education and community projects, raising public awareness of environmental issues and increasing support for environmental policies.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The implementation of the European Union's Emissions Trading System (ETS) in the energy sector has led to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, with a 43% decrease in emissions from power and heat production between 2005 and 2020. This reduction is attributed to the cap-and-trade mechanism, which incentivizes companies to innovate and adopt cleaner technologies. The economic impact has been mixed, with some companies facing higher operational costs, but the overall market has adapted through technological advancements and efficiency improvements.\n\nIn the transportation sector, the introduction of stricter emissions standards and incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) has resulted in a substantial increase in EV adoption. For example, Norway, which has one of the highest EV adoption rates in Europe, saw EVs account for 75% of new car sales in 2022. This shift has not only reduced local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions but has also stimulated the growth of the EV industry, creating new jobs and driving technological innovation.\n\nThe renovation wave strategy, part of the European Green Deal, has had a profound impact on the building sector by promoting energy-efficient renovations. This initiative has led to a 14% reduction in energy consumption in buildings between 2000 and 2020. The social benefits include reduced energy bills for households, improved living conditions, and the creation of jobs in the construction and renovation industries. However, the pace of renovation remains slow in some countries, highlighting the need for more targeted policies and financial incentives.\nEnvironmental regulations and standards in Europe are generally stricter than those in the United States and Japan, especially in terms of carbon emissions and energy efficiency. The European Green Deal sets a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and has passed several regulations, such as the EU Emissions Trading System and the Energy Efficiency Directive, to ensure this goal is met. In contrast, environmental policies in the United States have fluctuated significantly depending on the administration, although the Biden administration rejoined the Paris Agreement and set a 2050 carbon neutrality target, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding its implementation.\n\nWhile Japan's environmental regulations and standards are relatively strict in certain areas, such as automotive emission standards, they fall short of Europe's overall policy framework and enforcement. The Japanese government has set a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, but its policy tools and incentives are limited, primarily relying on voluntary emission reductions and technological innovation. Additionally, Japan lags behind in the promotion and use of renewable energy, remaining heavily dependent on fossil fuels.\n\nThe strict implementation of environmental regulations and standards in Europe has yielded significant results. For instance, the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) has effectively reduced carbon emissions from industrial and power sectors, with the EU's greenhouse gas emissions decreasing by 24% in 2019 compared to 1990. In contrast, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and Japan during the same period was less noticeable, with the U.S. seeing a 12% reduction and Japan showing little change. These data indicate that stringent regulations and standards play a crucial role in driving emission reductions.\nThe European Green Deal emphasizes multiple aspects of the circular economy, clean energy, and sustainable development, indicating that future European environmental policies will focus on advancing technological innovation and application in these areas. This includes reducing waste and improving resource efficiency, developing and using renewable energy, and building green infrastructure.\n\nThe development of environmental technology innovations will depend on substantial funding, including government grants, private investments, and international cooperation funds. These funds will support research and development projects, demonstration projects, and market promotion to accelerate the commercialization and large-scale application of technologies. For example, the EU has announced plans to invest over 1 trillion euros in green transition projects over the next decade.\n\nInternational cooperation plays a key role in implementing European environmental policies, particularly in technology transfer and experience sharing with non-EU countries. By establishing multilateral and bilateral cooperation mechanisms, Europe can more effectively address global environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity protection. For instance, the EU has signed green cooperation agreements with several countries and regions aimed at jointly researching and promoting environmental technologies.\nThe rise of the German Green Party in a fragmented party landscape has significantly influenced Germany's environmental policy-making. The Green Party has successfully attracted a large number of voters, especially among young people, by emphasizing environmental protection and sustainable development. In the 2021 federal election, the Green Party won 14.8% of the vote, becoming the third largest party. This achievement not only enhanced the Green Party's influence in parliament but also prompted other parties to pay more attention to environmental issues, leading to the introduction of several environmental policies, such as increasing the share of renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGreta Thunberg's silence on the issue of Japan's nuclear wastewater discharge reveals the complexities and contradictions in European environmental politics. Despite her global efforts to promote climate action, Thunberg's silence on this issue has raised questions about the politicization of the environmental movement. This event shows that environmental politics is not just about scientific discussions of environmental issues but also involves complex considerations of geopolitics and international relations. The positions of environmental activists and political parties may be influenced by various factors, including diplomatic relations and domestic political pressures.\n\nGreen parties across Europe have achieved significant success in promoting specific environmental policies, especially at the city level. For example, the Dutch Green Party in Amsterdam has promoted a 'green roof' program, encouraging residents and businesses to install green roofs through subsidies and regulations to improve urban heat island effects and rainwater management. Since its implementation in 2018, the program has successfully increased the area of green roofs by over 100,000 square meters, significantly enhancing the city's ecological sustainability. This successful case provides a model for other cities, demonstrating that local-level environmental policies can effectively promote environmental improvement.\nGermany has established a strict environmental legal system for air pollution control, ensuring the effective implementation of environmental policies through legislation and administrative measures. Rehbinder's research indicates that Germany leads in the codification of environmental law, providing a template for other European countries. Germany's experience shows that clear legal frameworks and strict enforcement mechanisms can effectively supervise and enforce environmental policies, ensuring continuous improvement in environmental quality.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The long-term implementation of the EU's green transition policies in agriculture has shown that, while the policies have promoted sustainable agricultural practices such as reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the growth rate of agricultural productivity has slowed down, leading to increased costs for some agricultural products. This has sparked protests from farmers in some member states, particularly in France and the Netherlands, where the agricultural sector heavily relies on traditional farming methods.\n\nIn the industrial sector, the EU's environmental policies have driven improvements in energy efficiency standards and the clean-up of industrial production, promoting the development and application of green technologies. However, these policies have also led to the outsourcing of some high-energy-consuming and highly polluting industries, especially to countries in Eastern and Southern Europe with lower environmental standards, potentially failing to achieve global emission reduction targets.\n\nEconomically and socially, the EU's green transition policies have spurred the growth of the green job market, particularly in renewable energy and environmental technology sectors. However, these new jobs are often concentrated in skill-intensive areas, leading to structural imbalances in the labor market, especially in regions with a higher proportion of low-skilled workers, where unemployment rates and economic inequality have worsened.\nComparisons of environmental regulations and standards between Europe, the United States, and Japan over the long term show that Europe leads in the implementation of carbon trading systems (ETS), which has been operational since 2005 and is now the world's largest carbon market. The ETS, through its cap-and-trade mechanism, has successfully driven a gradual reduction in carbon emissions, with the EU's greenhouse gas emissions decreasing by 24% compared to 1990 levels by 2021.\n\nEnvironmental policies in the United States vary significantly at the federal and state levels. Federal-level laws such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act have been in place since the 1970s, but the achievement of emission reduction targets lags behind Europe, mainly due to the lack of a national carbon pricing mechanism. In contrast, states like California have implemented more stringent local environmental measures, such as low-emission vehicle standards and renewable energy quotas, achieving significant emission reductions.\n\nJapan has taken a technology-driven approach to environmental regulations and standards, emphasizing energy efficiency improvements and the development of clean energy. Japan's Energy Management Law, implemented since 1979, has promoted energy efficiency in industry and transportation through mandatory efficiency standards and subsidy policies. By 2020, Japan's carbon intensity per unit of GDP had decreased by 27% compared to 1990, highlighting the importance of technology policies in emission reduction.\nThe EU's green transition policies emphasize technological innovation, with specific examples including large-scale investments in clean energy. For instance, the EU launched the 'European Green Deal,' aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. To achieve this, the EU plans to invest over 1 trillion euros, focusing on supporting research and application in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation technologies.\n\nThe funding mechanisms for the EU's green transition are diverse, combining public and private funds. The EU has established the 'Just Transition Fund' (JTF) to help regions and industries most affected by the green transition adjust economically. Additionally, the EU supports the commercialization of low-carbon technologies through the 'Innovation Fund,' which is expected to provide about 10 billion euros by 2030.\n\nInternational cooperation plays a crucial role in the EU's green transition, with specific examples including collaboration with China. In 2021, the EU and China jointly launched the 'Global Clean Energy Partnership' to promote the global application of clean energy technologies through technical exchanges and project cooperation. Furthermore, the EU collaborates with African countries through the 'African Renewable Energy Initiative' to support renewable energy projects in Africa, aiming to add 10 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity by 2020.\nThe German Green Party has achieved significant success in improving air quality through strict environmental regulations and policies, such as implementing vehicle emission standards and promoting clean energy, effectively reducing air pollution at both city and national levels. These measures not only improved environmental quality but also promoted the development and application of green technologies.\n\nUnder a fragmented party landscape, the German Green Party has enhanced its influence in federal and local politics through flexible coalition strategies and clear policy positions. For example, the Green Party forms coalition governments with the Social Democratic Party or the Christian Democratic Union in multiple state governments, jointly advancing a series of environmental policies, such as green transportation planning and urban greening projects.\n\nThe EU faces multiple challenges in advancing its green transition, including conflicts of interest among member states and difficulties in policy coordination. However, the German Green Party has actively participated in the formulation of environmental policies at the EU level, promoting cross-border cooperation and resource sharing, contributing to the realization of the goals of the European Green Deal. These efforts have not only enhanced the international reputation of the Green Party but also provided valuable experiences for other member states.\nRadical environmental organizations in Europe have effectively promoted environmental policies through carbon trading mechanisms, such as reducing carbon emissions through market means and fostering the development of a green economy. These organizations leverage the carbon trading market as a lever to push businesses and governments to adopt stricter environmental measures, thereby finding a balance between the economy and the environment. Successful cases include the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which has significantly reduced carbon emissions in EU member states since its launch in 2005, becoming the world's largest carbon market.\n\nThe role of grassroots movements in European environmental policies cannot be overlooked, especially at the local and community levels. For example, Germany's anti-nuclear movement and renewable energy movement, through extensive public participation and local initiatives, successfully pushed the German government to announce a phase-out of nuclear power in 2011 and accelerate the development of renewable energy. These grassroots movements not only raised public awareness of environmental issues but also directly influenced national policy-making, such as the implementation of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), which has promoted the rapid development of Germany's renewable energy industry.\n\nEnvironmental organizations in Europe have enhanced their influence on the international stage through transnational cooperation and networked actions. For example, international organizations like Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have successfully promoted the formulation and implementation of several transnational environmental policies through joint actions. These organizations use media and public opinion to pressure businesses and governments to take more proactive environmental measures, such as reducing plastic use and protecting biodiversity. Transnational cooperation not only improves the global consistency of environmental policies but also provides more resources and support to local environmental organizations.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The EU Common Agricultural Policy has significant potential in promoting low-carbon agriculture and biodiversity. Specific cases show that by implementing precision farming technologies and ecological agricultural practices, EU member states such as France and Germany have made substantial progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting biodiversity. For example, France has successfully reduced the carbon footprint of its agricultural sector and increased organic matter content in soil by promoting organic farming and reducing fertilizer use.\n\nThe EU supply chain ESG policies not only impact the industrial sector but also have profound economic and social impacts on agriculture. These policies require companies to disclose environmental, social, and governance risks in their supply chains, encouraging more sustainable production methods. For instance, the Dutch flower and horticulture industry has improved international competitiveness and reduced water resource dependence and chemical pesticide use by implementing ESG standards, thereby improving farmers' livelihoods and community environmental quality.\n\nChallenges faced by the European Green Deal include the complexity and cost of policy implementation, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the agricultural and industrial sectors. Although the EU provides financial support and technical guidance, many SMEs still face funding shortages and skill gaps during the transition process. For example, some small farms and processing enterprises in Italy have experienced slow progress in green transformation due to insufficient financial support and technical training, affecting overall policy effectiveness.\nEurope has long been a leader in environmental regulations and standards, particularly in the implementation of the Emissions Trading System (ETS). Since 2005, the EU's ETS has become the world's largest carbon market, covering about 45% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. This mechanism effectively promotes the achievement of emission reduction targets by setting emission caps and allowing companies to buy and sell emission allowances. By 2021, the EU's greenhouse gas emissions had decreased by 24% compared to 1990 levels, while the economy grew by 62%.\n\nEnvironmental policies in the United States have experienced significant fluctuations, especially at the federal level. During the Obama administration, the U.S. passed the Clean Power Plan, aiming to reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by 32% by 2030. However, the Trump administration repealed this plan and relaxed several environmental regulations. The Biden administration rejoined the Paris Agreement and set a goal of achieving zero-carbon pollution in the power sector by 2035. Despite this, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the U.S.'s ability to meet its emission reduction targets.\n\nJapan's environmental regulations and standards are relatively strict, but its emission reduction effects are less significant than those of Europe. In 2019, Japan revised the Global Warming Countermeasures Promotion Act, setting a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26% by 2030 compared to 2013 levels. However, Japan's reliance on nuclear energy and continued use of coal limit its emission reduction effectiveness. As of 2021, Japan's greenhouse gas emissions had only decreased by 14% compared to 2013 levels.\nThe EU's green transition policies are driving specific industry changes through technological innovation and financial investment. For example, in the renewable energy sector, the EU plans to increase the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption to 32% by 2030 and has invested over 100 billion euros in related R&D and infrastructure construction. Additionally, the EU has launched the 'Green Deal Industrial Plan' to support the commercialization of clean technologies, including hydrogen energy, battery storage, and carbon capture and storage technologies.\n\nInternational cooperation mechanisms play a crucial role in the EU's green transition, such as establishing multilateral and bilateral cooperation with non-EU countries through the 'European Green Deal' to promote global climate governance. Specific examples include collaborating with African countries to develop renewable energy projects and facilitate technology transfer, as well as engaging in climate dialogues and cooperation with major economies like the U.S. and China to address global climate change challenges.\n\nIn terms of financial investment, the EU has established the 'Just Transition Fund' to help regions dependent on fossil fuels achieve a green transition. The fund, totaling 17.5 billion euros, provides financial support and technical assistance to help these regions develop a green economy and mitigate socio-economic impacts during the transition. Additionally, the EU offers low-interest loans and guarantees through the European Investment Bank to attract private capital investment in green projects.\nThe German Green Party has achieved significant success in air pollution control through stringent environmental legislation and policy implementation, successfully reducing air pollutant concentrations in major cities. For example, cities like Berlin and Munich have significantly improved air quality by restricting high-emission vehicles, promoting electric buses, and increasing green spaces. These measures not only enhance residents' quality of life but also provide replicable models for other cities.\n\nUnder the framework of the European Green Deal, the Dutch Green Party has successfully promoted national-level sustainable agricultural policies. Specific measures include reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides, promoting organic farming, and improving soil health. These policies not only help reduce the environmental impact of agriculture but also promote sustainable agricultural economic development. The Dutch experience demonstrates that through multi-sector collaboration and scientific support, it is possible to achieve a win-win situation for environmental protection and economic development.\n\nThe Danish Green Party has played a significant role in urban energy transitions, particularly in Copenhagen's renewable energy projects. Copenhagen has become one of the first cities globally to achieve carbon neutrality by deploying large-scale wind and solar power facilities and promoting building energy efficiency. These initiatives not only reduce carbon emissions but also create numerous green job opportunities, providing practical examples for other cities.\nRadical environmental organizations in Europe have driven the implementation of various environmental policies through grassroots movements and public participation. For example, large-scale street protests and online petitions have successfully prompted governments to raise carbon emission standards. These movements not only increase public awareness of environmental issues but also directly push policymakers to take action. In 2019, the 'Fridays for Future' movement initiated by Greenpeace in Germany attracted hundreds of thousands of students, ultimately accelerating the legislative process for climate protection laws.\n\nEnvironmental organizations have promoted the establishment and development of carbon trading markets through collaboration with governments and businesses. For example, the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) worked with the EU to improve the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Since the launch of the EU ETS in 2005, the system has successfully reduced carbon emissions in the industrial and energy sectors. By 2020, the EU's total carbon emissions had decreased by 24% compared to 1990 levels.\n\nPublic participation in environmental policy-making cannot be overlooked, especially through citizen science projects and local community activities. For example, the 'Air Pollution Monitoring Network' project in the Netherlands, where citizen volunteers use portable monitoring devices to collect data, provides accurate air pollution information. This data is used to formulate stricter air quality standards and policies. This bottom-up participation model not only enhances the scientific accuracy and effectiveness of policies but also increases public environmental awareness and engagement.</learnings>\n"

After the EU was established, environmental policy became one of its core issues, and a series of environmental action plans and regulations were adopted, providing legal and institutional guarantees for environmental protection.\n- Active participation of civil society is a significant feature of the European environmental movement. Environmental organizations have successfully pushed environmental issues onto the political agenda and raised public awareness through protests, advocacy, and educational activities.\n- The rise of the green wave in Europe is driven by the urgency of climate change, increasing public concern about environmental issues, and the active involvement of younger generations, which has led to the rise of green parties in multiple European countries.\n- The rise of the German Green Party reflects voter dissatisfaction with traditional parties and a strong demand for more environmentally friendly policies. The Green Party has achieved breakthroughs in elections by effectively mobilizing supporters through social media and digital tools.\n- There are significant differences in environmental attitudes among European countries. Nordic countries like Sweden and Denmark are more proactive in their environmental policies, while Southern European countries like Italy and Greece lag behind. This difference reflects variations in economic development levels, political climates, and cultural backgrounds across different countries.\n- The EU's 'European Green Deal' comprehensively covers areas such as the circular economy, clean energy, and sustainable development, aiming to promote a green transition through a systematic policy framework and set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n- European environmental policies place greater emphasis on legislation and regulation, promoting the achievement of emission reduction targets through strict legal frameworks and standards, which is more aggressive than policies in the US and Japan.\n- The maturity and influence of carbon trading markets in Europe far exceed those of other developed economies. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), launched in 2005, has become the world's largest carbon trading market, effectively promoting the achievement of emission reduction targets.\n- European civil society plays a key role in promoting environmental policies through strong grassroots movements and advocacy groups, ensuring that governments and businesses comply with environmental regulations, and enhancing the transparency and effectiveness of policy implementation.\n</answer>"

The government has played a key role in promoting multicultural integration, for example, by enacting strict laws on racial and religious harmony and promoting multicultural education content in the education system.\n\nIn Singapore's social governance structure, community participation and grassroots organizations play important roles in maintaining social stability and promoting social integration. The government actively mobilizes community resources through institutions such as Community Development Councils (CDC) and People's Association (PA), organizing various cultural activities and community services to enhance communication and understanding among different ethnic groups.\n\nThe logic of ethnic governance in Singapore emphasizes the synergy between government, market, and society. Through the participation and cooperation of multiple entities, efficient social governance is achieved. The government not only provides policy support but also encourages businesses and social organizations to participate in social governance, forming a multi-level, multi-sector governance network to ensure the effective implementation of policies and timely resolution of social issues.\nThe Singapore government has successfully promoted the integration and harmony of multiculturalism through a series of policies and measures. These policies include multicultural education in the education system, ensuring that all students understand and respect different cultural backgrounds, thereby fostering shared values and national identity. For example, school curricula include festivals and history from different cultures, as well as multilingual education policies, ensuring that students can master multiple languages and promote cross-cultural communication.\n\nThe Community Development Councils (CDC) and People's Association (PA) have played significant roles in promoting multicultural interaction at the community level. These institutions organize various activities, such as cultural exhibitions, festival celebrations, and community service projects, encouraging residents from different backgrounds to participate and enhancing community cohesion and mutual understanding. Through these activities, residents can experience and appreciate other cultures and build trust and friendship in their daily lives.\n\nThe government ensures a fair and equal social environment through legislation and policy, which is an important guarantee for the integration of multiculturalism in Singapore. For example, the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act aims to prevent religious conflicts and ensure religious freedom and respect. Additionally, the government promotes housing policies, such as the racial quota system for public housing (HDB), to ensure balanced distribution of residents from different races in residential areas, avoiding racial segregation and promoting interaction and integration among different ethnic groups in daily life.\nSingapore has built a harmonious society through multicultural interaction, with specific practices including the implementation of strict racial and religious policies to ensure equality and respect among different ethnic groups. For example, the Singapore government prevents religious conflicts through the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, ensuring that religious activities are conducted within the legal framework, thus maintaining social stability and harmony.\n\nSingapore's path of social governance emphasizes the important role of education and public housing policies in promoting social integration. The government promotes multicultural education to ensure that students in schools can be exposed to different cultures and languages, fostering cross-cultural understanding. At the same time, the HDB policy promotes interaction and integration among neighbors by mixing residents from different races and income groups in residential areas, reducing social barriers.\n\nResearch from Fudan University points out that the close cooperation between universities, local communities, and the government has played a key role in building an innovative city in Singapore. For example, universities like the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University collaborate with local governments to promote technological innovation and industrial incubation, forming a knowledge-based economic system that provides momentum for the sustainable development of the city.\nSingapore's grassroots social governance model emphasizes the application of hyper-rationalism in the government's governance structure, using scientific, systematic, and data-driven decision-making methods to ensure the efficiency and precision of policies. The government has established multi-level community participation mechanisms, such as Residents' Committees, Community Centers, and People's Associations, combining top-down policy implementation with bottom-up public feedback, forming a unique two-way interactive model.\n\nSingapore's economic and social policies are highly integrated, with the government using comprehensive planning and execution mechanisms to closely link economic goals with social goals, ensuring social stability and sustained economic growth. For example, Singapore's housing policy not only addresses the housing needs of residents but also promotes social integration and community cohesion through the HDB system.\n\nIn Singapore's social governance model, the government places great importance on the application of technology and data, using intelligent and information-based means to improve governance efficiency. For example, the government uses big data and artificial intelligence technologies to optimize public services and administrative efficiency, while the Smart Nation initiative promotes urban digitalization, enhancing urban management and the convenience of residents' lives.\nThe construction of common values in Singapore's social governance model provides a solid foundation for social harmony and economic development. By emphasizing the coexistence of multiculturalism, national identity, and collectivism, Singapore has successfully built a stable social environment, which offers important lessons for other multicultural countries.\n\nSingapore's social governance model demonstrates high flexibility and adaptability in economic transformation. In the face of challenges from globalization and technological changes, Singapore continuously adjusts its economic policies and education system to maintain its competitiveness in the global economy. This flexible governance model provides feasible references for other countries facing similar challenges.\n\nSingapore's investment and policy support in science and technology and innovation provide momentum for the continuous development of its society and economy. Through government-led construction of technology parks, support for innovative enterprises, and attraction of research talents, Singapore has achieved significant success in technological innovation, offering valuable experience for other countries in promoting technological innovation and development.</learnings>\n"

By promoting English and mother tongues in the education system, Singapore has successfully established a unified national consciousness in a multicultural society while preserving the cultural characteristics of each community.\n\nLee Kuan Yew's political approach emphasized the combination of socialism and market economy, laying the foundation for Singapore's social governance model. This model ensures efficient economic development while achieving social stability and equity through active government intervention and social welfare policies.\n\nThe construction of shared values is an important part of social governance. Through the joint efforts of the government, society, and citizens, a value system that respects multiculturalism, emphasizes social harmony, and promotes common progress has been formed. This value system not only enhances social cohesion but also provides a guarantee for Singapore to maintain its uniqueness in the context of globalization.\nSingapore's social governance model has shown significant results in the economic field, especially in national governance and economic policy formulation. Lee Kuan Yew's super-rationalist philosophy emphasized the key role of the government in economic development. Through effective policy interventions and long-term planning, Singapore has achieved rapid economic growth and structural transformation. For example, by attracting foreign investment, developing high-tech industries and financial services, Singapore has transformed from a resource-poor small country into a global leading economic center.\n\nIn the education sector, Singapore's education system focuses on elite cultivation and fair competition, ensuring educational quality through strict standards and examination systems.

The government has established a multi-level healthcare system through public-private partnerships, ensuring the accessibility and availability of medical services. Singapore's healthcare system achieves high medical quality and low medical costs through strict cost control and advanced medical technology. For example, healthcare expenditure in Singapore accounts for only about 2% of GDP, much lower than many developed countries, yet the quality of medical services and patient satisfaction are very high.\nSingapore's social governance model faces challenges from an aging population, which increases the government's fiscal burden and places higher demands on healthcare and pension systems. To address this challenge, the government is actively promoting reforms in the healthcare system, including greater private sector participation and improved service efficiency, while exploring diversified pension mechanisms such as community-based care and family support.\n\nSingapore's social governance model faces challenges in digital transformation. Despite substantial investments in the Smart Nation initiative, ensuring all residents can fairly access digital services remains a challenge. The government is addressing this issue by enhancing digital literacy, providing digital skills training, and optimizing digital infrastructure, while also exploring how to protect personal information through data privacy and security regulations.\n\nSingapore's social governance model still needs to promote social inclusion and diversity. Although the government has made significant achievements in racial and religious harmony, challenges remain in areas such as socioeconomic inequality, immigrant integration, and social stratification. The government is promoting social mobility through education and employment policies and strengthening community building and social services to enhance social cohesion and inclusiveness.\nSingapore's government-led social governance model emphasizes the core role of the government in social management and public services. Through an efficient administrative system and strict laws and regulations, it ensures social order and the quality of public services. This model is particularly prominent in grassroots social governance, where the government directly participates in community management and service provision through community centers, residents' committees, and other institutions, forming a top-down governance structure. This model demonstrates high efficiency and coordination in addressing social issues and promoting social services.\n\nSingapore's social governance model focuses on social harmony and the integration of multiculturalism. Through a series of policies and measures, it promotes mutual understanding and respect among different ethnic groups. For example, the government's public housing policy (HDB) ensures mixed living arrangements for different ethnic groups, avoiding racial segregation in communities. Additionally, the government promotes multicultural values through education, media, and public activities, maintaining social stability and harmony.\n\nSingapore's social governance model emphasizes prevention and early intervention. By establishing a comprehensive community support system, it identifies and addresses potential social problems in a timely manner. For example, the government has set up family service centers, mental health service centers, and other institutions to provide early intervention and support to those in need. These preventive measures not only reduce the incidence of social problems but also improve residents' quality of life and social well-being.</learnings>\n"

This policy was particularly important in the early years of independence, aiming to enhance national cohesion through a common language while preserving the cultural traditions of each ethnic group, thus laying the foundation for the integration of multiculturalism.\n\nIn social governance, Singapore adopted a multiculturalism policy, ensuring equal rights and cultural autonomy for all ethnic groups through legal and policy measures, such as setting up Racial Harmony Day and religious holiday observances. These policies have effectively promoted social harmony and stability. Additionally, the government has taken specific measures like community centers and public housing policies to promote interaction and integration among different ethnic groups, enhancing social cohesion and inclusiveness.\n\nSingapore's model of social governance emphasizes a combination of top-down policy guidance and bottom-up community participation when addressing the integration of multiculturalism. The government not only promotes the integration of multiculturalism through legislation and administrative means but also actively encourages community organizations and non-governmental groups to participate in social governance by organizing various cultural activities and community projects, thereby fostering mutual understanding and recognition among different ethnic groups and forming a unique mechanism of social governance.\nIn the economic sector, Singapore's governance model emphasizes the active role of the state in economic development. Through government-led economic development strategies, Singapore has successfully transformed into a global financial and business center. The government has established specialized agencies such as the Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), formulating and implementing a series of policies to promote economic development, including tax incentives, foreign investment attraction, talent cultivation, and technology introduction. These measures have not only driven rapid economic growth but also ensured the diversification and sustainability of the economic structure.\n\nIn the education sector, Singapore implements a highly centralized education system. The government ensures high-quality education through strict standards and assessment systems. Singapore's education system focuses on solid foundational education and internationalization of higher education, attracting a large number of international students and academic talents through world-renowned institutions like the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University. Additionally, Singapore has introduced more innovative and practical courses through educational reforms to foster critical thinking and innovation among students.\n\nIn the healthcare sector, Singapore operates a market-oriented healthcare system combined with government regulation and subsidies, ensuring efficient and fair healthcare. Singapore's healthcare system includes both public and private sectors. The government provides basic medical services and subsidies to ensure healthcare coverage for low-income groups. Meanwhile, the private healthcare sector offers high-quality medical services through competition and innovation. Singapore's healthcare system has achieved significant success domestically and attracts a large number of international medical tourists, becoming a leading healthcare center in Asia.\nTo address population aging, Singapore launched the 'Active Ageing' program, aiming to create an environment that supports the active participation of seniors in social life. The program includes providing various community activities, health management, and re-employment opportunities to improve the quality of life and social participation of seniors. The government also encourages businesses and communities to provide suitable job positions and volunteer opportunities for seniors through subsidies and tax incentives.\n\nIn digital transformation, the Singapore government formulated the 'Digital Government Transformation Plan for the 14th Five-Year Plan', emphasizing the importance of digital technology in improving the efficiency and transparency of public services. The plan proposes building comprehensive digital infrastructure, including high-speed broadband networks, data centers, and cloud computing platforms, as well as promoting the online and intelligent delivery of government services. Additionally, the government plans to enhance citizens' digital literacy through training and education programs, ensuring that people of all age groups can benefit from digital transformation.\n\nTo enhance social inclusiveness, the Singapore government has taken several measures, including providing diverse education and training opportunities to help disadvantaged groups improve their skills and employment capabilities. The government also alleviates the economic burden of low-income families through housing subsidies, medical assistance, and social welfare programs. Furthermore, the government actively promotes the integration of multiculturalism by organizing various cultural activities and community projects to facilitate communication and understanding among residents from different backgrounds, building a harmonious and inclusive social environment.\nIn the grassroots social governance model, the community management mechanism led by the government is key to its success. The government has established institutions such as Community Development Councils (CDC) and People's Association (PA) to achieve efficient management and resource allocation from top to bottom. These institutions are responsible for organizing community activities, solving residents' problems, promoting social integration, and enhancing community cohesion. For example, Singapore's Housing and Development Board (HDB) areas have achieved high resident satisfaction and community participation rates through the coordination of these institutions.\n\nThe rule of law and strict enforcement mechanisms provide a solid foundation for Singapore's social governance. The government ensures social order and public safety through the formulation and enforcement of strict laws and regulations. For instance, laws such as the Public Order Act and the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act effectively combat crime and the spread of false information. The strict enforcement of these laws not only maintains social stability but also enhances public trust and support for the government.\n\nIn social governance, Singapore emphasizes technological application and innovation, especially in smart city construction. The government introduces technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things to achieve intelligent and efficient urban management. For example, Singapore's 'Smart Nation 2025' initiative aims to enhance the efficiency and quality of public services through technological means. Specific examples include smart traffic systems, smart waste collection systems, and smart healthcare systems, which not only improve the efficiency of urban management but also enhance the quality of life for residents.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Singapore's bilingual policy has shown specific implementation details and effects at different historical stages. In the initial phase (1965-1979), the focus was on a dual-track system of English and mother tongue education, aimed at promoting national unity and economic development. During this period, the government established a bilingual education system to ensure that students learned English without neglecting their mother tongues, thereby enhancing the country's multicultural identity.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1999, the bilingual policy was further deepened, especially in improving the quality of mother tongue education. The government introduced a series of measures, such as the 'Special Assistance Plan' and the 'Mother Tongue Language Improvement Program', to enhance the teaching levels of Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. These measures not only improved students' proficiency in their mother tongues but also promoted cultural exchange and understanding among different ethnic groups.\n\nIn the 21st century, the bilingual policy has placed greater emphasis on practicality and international competitiveness. The government introduced more international education programs and bilingual teaching resources, strengthening the integration of English and mother tongue education. For example, the 'Bilingual and Bicultural Program' launched in 2000 aims to cultivate bilingual talents capable of thriving in a globalized environment, which has not only enhanced Singapore's international image but also boosted its competitiveness in the global economy.\nSingapore has made significant progress in applying artificial intelligence technology in healthcare, improving diagnostic efficiency and treatment outcomes. For instance, the National University Hospital of Singapore has collaborated with several tech companies to develop AI systems that assist doctors in early cancer detection, significantly increasing the accuracy and early detection rates.\n\nSingapore's education policy focuses on fostering students' innovation and practical application skills to meet future economic needs. The government has launched various projects, such as the 'Smart Nation Initiative' and 'SkillsFuture', which provide lifelong learning opportunities and encourage students to engage in technological and entrepreneurial activities, laying a solid foundation for their future career development.\n\nIn the construction of economic zones, Singapore attracts foreign investment through policy innovation and international cooperation, driving regional economic growth. The Johor-Singapore Economic Corridor is a successful case, where optimized tax policies and one-stop services have attracted numerous multinational corporations and startups, boosting local employment and economic growth.\nSingapore implements comprehensive policies and projects to address population aging, including the launch of the 'Silver Generation Office', which aims to promote employment, training, and community participation for seniors. This program offers a range of training courses to help seniors acquire digital skills and better integrate into the digital society. Additionally, the government has launched the 'Smart Nation 2025' plan, which includes smart technology applications specifically designed for seniors, such as intelligent health monitoring devices and telemedicine services, to improve their quality of life.\n\nIn terms of digital transformation, Singapore has taken multifaceted measures, focusing not only on the popularization and application of technology but also on enhancing digital literacy across society. The government's 'Digital Literacy Programme' provides basic digital skills training for seniors, including the use of smartphones, internet, and social media. Furthermore, the government collaborates with the private sector to introduce a series of digital tools and services, such as the 'Silver View' platform, to help seniors access information, participate in community activities, and enjoy government services.\n\nTo promote social inclusiveness, Singapore adopts a multi-pronged strategy, encompassing economic, educational, and social support. The government's 'Community Care' program provides economic assistance and living support to low-income and vulnerable groups, ensuring that seniors are economically secure. Additionally, the 'Lifelong Learning' policy encourages seniors to continue learning and participating in social activities, enhancing their sense of belonging and participation.\nSingapore's governance model effectively promotes harmonious coexistence among different ethnic groups through policies and mechanisms that foster multicultural integration. For example, the 'Racial Integration Policy' (RIP) implemented by the Singapore government requires that different ethnic groups be proportionally allocated in new public housing developments, thus avoiding ethnic segregation and conflict. This approach can serve as a reference for other countries facing multicultural challenges, helping them promote ethnic integration in housing and social policies.\n\nSingapore's education system emphasizes multiculturalism and civic education, fostering a sense of national identity and inclusiveness from a young age. School education in Singapore not only covers the history and culture of different ethnic groups but also stresses the importance of English as a common language to facilitate communication and understanding among students from diverse backgrounds. This approach can provide valuable lessons for other countries, particularly in designing education policies and curricula that strengthen multicultural education and civic education to enhance social cohesion and national identity.\n\nThe Singapore government has established strong community networks and grassroots organizations to effectively address social issues and promote community participation. For example, the 'People's Association' (PA) is a nationwide community organization responsible for organizing various community activities and projects, enhancing neighborhood relations, and solving community problems. This model of community participation and grassroots organization can serve as a reference for other countries, especially in community governance and social services, by establishing similar organizations and networks to enhance community self-management and problem-solving capabilities.</learnings>\n"

Platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, through QR code payments, NFC technology, and mobile apps, have significantly reduced transaction costs and time, allowing both consumers and merchants to enjoy a fast payment experience.\n\nGovernment policy support and promotion are important factors in the widespread adoption of mobile payments. Since 2010, the Chinese government has introduced a series of policies to encourage the development of financial technology, with innovative payment methods, including mobile payments, receiving strong policy support, providing a favorable environment for market development.\n\nThe widespread use of mobile payments also benefits from China's large internet user base. By the end of 2021, the number of internet users in China reached 1.032 billion, with mobile internet users accounting for over 99%, providing a vast user base and market potential for the spread of mobile payments.\nOne of the main reasons for the slower adoption of mobile payments in developed countries is the highly mature and widely used credit card system. In these countries, credit cards are not only highly prevalent but also offer convenient and secure payment systems, forming stable user habits. For example, the use of credit cards is extremely high in the US and Europe, with companies like Visa, MasterCard, and American Express offering extensive services and benefits, reducing the need for mobile payment alternatives.\n\nAnother reason is the strict regulatory environment and legal framework. Developed countries have more comprehensive financial regulatory systems, with very strict approval and regulation for emerging payment methods, which to some extent hinders the rapid development of mobile payments. For example, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict requirements on data protection and privacy, increasing compliance costs for mobile payment companies in data processing and user privacy protection.\n\nFinally, high demands for security and privacy are also important factors for the slower adoption of mobile payments in developed countries. Consumers in these countries have a strong awareness of personal data protection and higher expectations for the security of mobile payments. For example, a 2019 survey showed that the biggest concern for American consumers regarding mobile payments is data breaches and privacy issues, leading to lower acceptance of mobile payments.\nThe widespread adoption of mobile payments in China is due to government policy support and the improvement of technical infrastructure. For instance, the Chinese government has promoted the security and convenience of mobile payment systems by formulating a series of policies and standards, while the widespread availability of high-speed internet and smartphones has also provided a foundation for the rapid development of mobile payments. In contrast, although developed countries are technologically advanced, differences in policy and market environments have limited the speed of mobile payment adoption.\n\nThe extensive application of mobile payments in China has had a significant positive impact on county economies, not only improving transaction efficiency and financial inclusion but also promoting the digital transformation of local businesses and small and micro merchants. According to relevant research, the widespread use of mobile payments has made consumption activities more active in county areas, injecting new vitality into the local economy and providing important support for financial inclusion in rural areas.\n\nSocial and cultural factors have played a key role in the widespread adoption of mobile payments in China. Chinese consumers have a high acceptance of new technologies and strong online payment habits, largely due to the rapid development of mobile internet and the widespread use of social media platforms. Additionally, the advocacy of a cashless society and the younger generation's preference for convenient payment methods have also accelerated the adoption of mobile payments.\nThe widespread adoption of mobile payments has significantly increased residents' willingness to participate in venture capital. According to an analysis by MBAChina, the convenience and efficiency of mobile payments have lowered transaction barriers, making more ordinary residents willing to try venture capital, thereby increasing the activity and liquidity of the investment market.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The stable economic growth in Southeast Asia is a key factor attracting international capital inflows. According to the report by '21 Finance', ASEAN member countries have maintained high economic growth rates over the past few years, providing a stable investment environment and higher return expectations for international investors.\n\nChina's investment in Southeast Asia has significantly increased, becoming an important source of capital for the region. The 'China Economic Times' points out that China's outbound investment has entered a 'fast track' in recent years, with Southeast Asia becoming one of the main investment destinations. Chinese companies have made substantial investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and high-tech sectors, driving local economic development and industrial upgrading.\n\nThe policy and market advantages of Southeast Asia are also important reasons for attracting international investment. Many Southeast Asian countries have implemented policies to attract foreign investment, such as offering tax incentives, simplifying investment approval processes, and opening up multiple economic sectors. Additionally, the region's young labor force, large consumer market, and growing middle class provide significant business opportunities for foreign enterprises.\nSoutheast Asia has a significant advantage in labor costs compared to other emerging economies like India and Latin America, with lower average wage levels, especially in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar. For example, the average monthly salary in Vietnam is around $250, much lower than India's $350 and Mexico's $600.\n\nThe young population structure in Southeast Asia provides strong momentum for economic development, with a higher proportion of working-age population and a population growth rate above the global average. For instance, the working-age population in countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam exceeds 60%, providing abundant labor resources and promoting economic growth and the expansion of consumer markets.\n\nThe digital economy in Southeast Asia is developing rapidly, particularly in mobile internet and e-commerce, attracting significant attention from international investors. For example, countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand have high internet penetration rates, and the number of mobile payment and online shopping users is growing rapidly. According to Statista, the e-commerce market size in Southeast Asia reached $85 billion in 2022 and is expected to exceed $172 billion by 2025.\nThe political stability of Southeast Asia is a key risk for investment. Several countries in the region, such as Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines, have experienced political unrest and government changes in recent years, negatively impacting investor confidence and project implementation. Political instability can lead to frequent policy changes, increasing investment uncertainty.\n\nThere is a significant infrastructure gap in Southeast Asia, which presents both challenges and opportunities. According to the 2024 'Belt and Road' Regional Risk Series Report, the region still requires substantial investment in transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure. For example, unstable power supply in countries like Myanmar and Laos affects industrial and commercial activities. At the same time, improving infrastructure will enhance regional connectivity and economic efficiency.\n\nAlthough the labor market in Southeast Asia is large and relatively low-cost, skill levels and education vary widely. This poses challenges for companies in recruitment and training. For example, despite having a large young workforce, countries like Vietnam and Cambodia lack skilled workers and management talent. Companies need to invest in employee training and skill enhancement to ensure smooth project execution.\nASEAN has become a hot spot for global investment, especially in Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. These countries attract a large amount of foreign direct investment due to policy support, market potential, and cost advantages in labor, particularly in manufacturing, information technology, and services.\n\nVietnam and Indonesia are major destinations for manufacturing investment in Southeast Asia, benefiting from their large young workforce and proactive government policies. Vietnam excels in electronics manufacturing, automotive parts, and textiles, while Indonesia has significant advantages in automotive manufacturing, food processing, and infrastructure construction.\n\nSingapore and Malaysia stand out in information technology and financial services, attracting many international companies to set up regional headquarters and R&D centers. Singapore, with its advanced financial system and favorable business environment, is the preferred location for fintech and high-tech companies, while Malaysia is competitive in semiconductors and software development.\nChina's investment in Southeast Asia has significantly accelerated in 2025, particularly in infrastructure and the digital economy. For example, Chinese companies have played a key role in projects such as the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway in Indonesia and smart city projects in Vietnam, enhancing local infrastructure levels and promoting regional connectivity and economic integration.\n\nSoutheast Asia demonstrates diversified appeal in attracting international investment, including rich natural resources, a large young workforce, and a growing consumer market. For example, Thailand's automotive industry and Malaysia's electronics sector have attracted substantial foreign investment, creating numerous job opportunities and optimizing the economic structure.\n\nWhile Southeast Asia offers significant investment opportunities, investors also face various challenges, including political instability, an incomplete legal system, and inadequate infrastructure. For instance, political turmoil in Myanmar and the complex legal environment in the Philippines pose risks to investors, so it is recommended that investors conduct thorough due diligence and risk assessments before entering the market.</learnings>\n"

At the same time, countries are gradually promoting economic integration within the region, simplifying cross-border investment and trade processes.\nChinese VC institutions focus their investments in Southeast Asia on technology, consumer goods, and healthcare. For example, EqualOcean's report indicates that these institutions pay attention to industries such as e-commerce, fintech, health tech, and edtech. Specific cases include significant investments by Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand.\n\nThe rise of the Southeast Asian market has attracted the attention of international investors, especially in Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. These countries have become investment hotspots due to political stability, economic growth, and demographic dividends. For instance, BRCCC's report suggests that Thailand is expected to become a new investment opportunity in the region by 2025, particularly in automotive manufacturing, electronics manufacturing, and agricultural technology.\n\nThe consumer market in Southeast Asia is growing rapidly, and international investors are particularly interested in e-commerce and fintech. According to EqualOcean's report, the number of internet users in Southeast Asia is expected to reach 400 million by 2025. This provides enormous market potential for e-commerce platforms and fintech companies, attracting substantial international capital.\nChinese outbound investment in Southeast Asia is expected to reach new heights by 2025, especially in infrastructure construction, the digital economy, and manufacturing. For example, Chinese enterprises' involvement in Thailand's high-speed rail projects and industrial park developments in Indonesia not only enhances these countries' infrastructure but also promotes local employment and economic growth. Additionally, China's investments in the digital economy in Southeast Asia, such as e-commerce platforms and fintech companies, are rapidly changing local consumption patterns and financial service landscapes.\n\nASEAN countries have varying levels of acceptance of Chinese investment, with some countries like Vietnam and the Philippines being more cautious due to historical and geopolitical reasons. This difference is evident in investment policies and regulatory environments, with Vietnam having stricter reviews of foreign investments and Singapore being more open and welcoming. This requires Chinese enterprises to conduct thorough policy research and risk assessments when entering the market.\n\nChinese investment in Southeast Asia not only brings positive economic impacts but also facilitates cultural and technological exchanges. For example, Chinese enterprises' agricultural technology cooperation projects in Malaysia and Cambodia have not only improved local agricultural productivity but also promoted technology transfer and talent development. Moreover, Chinese enterprises' community building and social responsibility projects, such as the construction of educational and medical facilities, have enhanced local communities' recognition and goodwill towards Chinese enterprises.\nSoutheast Asia has a strong demand for infrastructure construction, particularly in the building materials sector, such as plastic pipes, where leading Chinese plastic pipe companies stand to benefit. According to the 2019 'Belt and Road' Infrastructure Index report, Southeast Asia is experiencing strong momentum in energy infrastructure construction, indicating significant potential in energy projects. Major ASEAN countries offer notable opportunities in the infrastructure construction market, including projects in roads, bridges, ports, and power, providing broad market space for international investors and contractors.\nSoutheast Asia faces multiple challenges in education and skills training during the digital transformation, including inadequate infrastructure, lack of digital skills, and insufficient funding. Although ASEAN countries are striving to promote the development of edtech, internet access and the availability of high-quality educational content remain major obstacles in remote and rural areas.\n\nCooperation between China and Southeast Asian countries in vocational education is deepening, with both sides engaging in in-depth exchanges through activities such as principal workshops, focusing on curriculum development, teacher training, and resource sharing. This collaboration helps improve the quality of vocational education in Southeast Asian countries, promoting skill development and labor market alignment within the region.\n\nThe potential of edtech in the Southeast Asian market is significant, but it requires innovation and customization to meet local needs. For example, developing educational applications suitable for low-bandwidth environments, providing multilingual support, and designing teaching content that aligns with local culture and education systems. These measures will help increase the adoption rate and effectiveness of edtech.</learnings>\n"

I will ensure that each finding includes key points and specific data to support users with sufficient information.</think><answer>- A key factor attracting substantial international investment in Southeast Asia is its stable economic growth. ASEAN member countries have maintained high economic growth rates over the past few years, providing a stable investment environment and high return expectations for international investors.\n- The policy and market advantages in Southeast Asia, including tax incentives, simplified investment approval processes, and openness in multiple economic sectors, have attracted many international investors. Additionally, the region's young workforce, large consumer market, and growing middle class offer significant business opportunities for foreign companies.\n- Southeast Asia has a significant advantage in labor costs. Compared to other emerging economies like India and Latin America, the average wage levels are lower, especially in countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar, which attract a lot of foreign investment in labor-intensive industries.\n- The digital economy in Southeast Asia is developing rapidly, particularly in mobile internet and e-commerce, attracting considerable attention from international investors. In 2022, the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia reached $85 billion, and it is expected to exceed $172 billion by 2025.\n- Political stability in Southeast Asia is a key risk for investment. Several countries in the region, such as Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines, have experienced political unrest and government changes in recent years, negatively impacting investor confidence and project implementation.\n- There is a significant infrastructure gap in Southeast Asia, which presents both challenges and opportunities. The region still requires substantial investment in transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure. Improvements in infrastructure will enhance regional connectivity and economic efficiency.\n- Although the labor market in Southeast Asia is large and relatively low-cost, skill levels and education vary widely, posing challenges for recruitment and training. Companies need to invest in employee training and skill development to ensure smooth project execution.\n- Chinese investment in Southeast Asia has significantly increased, becoming an important source of capital, especially in infrastructure and the digital economy. These investments not only improve local infrastructure but also promote regional connectivity and economic integration.\n- The acceptance of Chinese investment varies among Southeast Asian countries. Some countries, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, are cautious due to historical and geopolitical reasons. This difference requires Chinese companies to conduct thorough policy research and risk assessments when entering the market.</answer>"

This hybrid approach, as detailed in the NVIDIA Blog, allows RAG models to dynamically fetch relevant data during inference, thereby reducing the reliance on pre-trained knowledge and improving the contextual relevance and factual accuracy of generated content.\n\nThe 2025 landscape of RAG, as outlined in the Glean article, highlights significant advancements in the scalability and efficiency of retrieval mechanisms. These improvements have enabled RAG models to handle large-scale datasets and real-time information retrieval, making them more practical for applications such as customer service chatbots, virtual assistants, and content creation platforms. The integration of advanced indexing and search algorithms has further optimized the retrieval process, reducing latency and enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.\n\nComparative studies, as presented in the arXiv paper, have demonstrated that RAG models outperform traditional generative models in tasks requiring high factual accuracy and context sensitivity. These studies show that RAG models achieve higher F1 scores and lower perplexity in tasks such as question answering and summarization, indicating their superior ability to generate coherent and factually accurate outputs. The paper also highlights the importance of fine-tuning the retrieval and generation components to achieve optimal performance, suggesting that a balanced integration of these components is crucial for maximizing the benefits of RAG.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant responses, particularly in specialized domains such as medicine, law, and scientific research.\n\nThe integration of RAG in LLMs addresses the issue of hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect or inconsistent information, by providing a mechanism to verify and augment model outputs with reliable, external data, thus improving the reliability and trustworthiness of the generated content.\n\nExperiments and case studies have demonstrated that RAG can achieve state-of-the-art results in tasks such as question answering, text summarization, and information retrieval, with models showing up to a 20% improvement in performance metrics compared to their non-augmented counterparts.\nGenerative AI models are being integrated into search engines to provide more accurate and contextually relevant results, moving beyond simple keyword matching to understanding user intent and generating natural language responses. This integration enhances the user experience by offering direct answers to queries, reducing the need for users to sift through multiple links. For instance, Splore's generative search engine uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) to understand complex queries and provide precise, human-like responses.\n\nThe combination of generative models and search engines is driving a shift from information retrieval to information synthesis, where the search engine not only retrieves data but also generates new, contextually appropriate content. TechnoLynx highlights that this approach can significantly improve the relevance and quality of search results, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries. This synthesis capability is particularly valuable in fields such as legal research, where the ability to generate coherent and contextually accurate summaries can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the research process.\n\nGenerative search engines are also being designed to handle a broader range of query types, including those that require multi-step reasoning or the integration of data from multiple sources. EDRM emphasizes that these models can effectively combine information from various databases and knowledge graphs, providing comprehensive and nuanced answers. This capability is crucial for applications in fields such as healthcare, where the synthesis of information from diverse sources can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the reliability and accuracy of generative models by integrating a retrieval component that fetches relevant information from a knowledge base, which is then used to condition the generative process. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both retrieval and generation, ensuring that the output is both contextually accurate and coherent.\n\nRAG systems, such as those developed by NVIDIA, have demonstrated significant improvements in tasks requiring factual accuracy, such as question answering and content generation, by dynamically retrieving and incorporating up-to-date information from external sources. This reduces the risk of generating outdated or incorrect information, which is a common issue with purely generative models.\n\nThe integration of RAG in AI content generation workflows can be particularly beneficial in domains where accuracy and reliability are critical, such as legal, medical, and financial applications. By ensuring that the generated content is grounded in verified and relevant data, RAG can help mitigate the risks associated with AI-generated content, thereby increasing user trust and adoption.</learnings>\n"

In the healthcare sector, RAG has been utilized by a leading hospital network to improve diagnostic accuracy, reducing misdiagnosis rates by 15% through the integration of patient records with the latest medical research. In the customer service industry, a major telecommunications company deployed RAG to augment chatbot responses, resulting in a 30% increase in customer satisfaction scores by providing more accurate and contextually relevant information.\nRAG models in healthcare, legal, and finance face significant challenges in data privacy and compliance, as these domains require stringent regulations and the handling of sensitive information, leading to increased complexity in data retrieval and generation processes. The integration of RAG models in these domains is often hampered by domain-specific language and jargon, which can result in suboptimal retrieval and generation accuracy, necessitating extensive fine-tuning and domain-specific training data. In finance, the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of financial data, coupled with the need for real-time accuracy, poses unique challenges for RAG models, requiring robust and adaptive retrieval mechanisms to ensure timely and accurate information generation.\nRAG is evolving to integrate more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms, such as semantic search and context-aware indexing, which are expected to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated content by better aligning with user queries and contextual information. This trend is driven by companies like CelerData, which are pioneering the use of advanced neural networks to refine the retrieval process and reduce the latency in information retrieval, making RAG systems more efficient and scalable.\n\nThe integration of RAG with multi-modal data, including text, images, and video, is a key area of innovation, enabling more comprehensive and contextually rich generative models.

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Real-world deployment of RAG models in enterprise environments often involves integrating RAG with existing data infrastructure, such as databases and knowledge bases, to enhance the retrieval and generation processes. For example, at a large financial institution, RAG was deployed to improve customer service by integrating with a customer relationship management (CRM) system, resulting in a 20% reduction in query resolution time and a 15% increase in customer satisfaction scores.\n\nBest practices for deploying RAG models include continuous monitoring and fine-tuning of the retrieval and generation components to ensure high accuracy and relevance. For instance, a healthcare provider implemented a RAG model to assist in medical diagnosis, and they established a feedback loop where clinicians could rate the quality of generated responses, leading to a 25% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over six months.\n\nSecurity and compliance are critical considerations in RAG deployments, especially in regulated industries. A telecommunications company deployed a RAG model for automated content generation and implemented strict data access controls and encryption to comply with GDPR and other regulations, ensuring that sensitive customer data was protected while maintaining high performance and reliability.\nHuman oversight significantly enhances the performance of RAG models in critical sectors such as healthcare, legal, and finance by ensuring that AI-generated outputs are accurate, contextually relevant, and compliant with regulatory standards. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both human expertise and machine learning, reducing the risk of errors and improving the overall reliability of RAG systems.\n\nIn financial services, RAG models face unique challenges such as handling sensitive data, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining high accuracy in transactional and advisory tasks. Solutions include implementing robust data anonymization techniques, integrating compliance modules, and utilizing secure, auditable data pipelines to address these issues effectively.\n\nRAG models in healthcare must navigate complex medical terminologies, patient confidentiality, and the need for real-time, high-stakes decision-making. Deploying RAG with advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities and strict data governance frameworks can help mitigate these challenges, ensuring that the models provide accurate and actionable insights while maintaining patient privacy and data security.\nRAG models are evolving to integrate more sophisticated pre-training techniques, such as contrastive learning and self-supervised learning, which enhance the model's ability to understand and retrieve contextually relevant information from large datasets. These advancements are expected to significantly improve the performance of RAG models in tasks like question-answering and document summarization by reducing the reliance on large annotated datasets and improving the robustness of the retrieval process.\n\nEmerging research in RAG is focusing on the development of hybrid models that combine the strengths of dense and sparse retrieval methods, leading to more efficient and accurate information retrieval. These hybrid approaches aim to leverage the high recall of dense retrieval with the precision of sparse retrieval, thereby addressing the limitations of each method individually. Companies like Google and Facebook are at the forefront of this research, with notable contributions from their respective AI research labs.\n\nThe integration of RAG models with multimodal data sources, such as images and videos, is an active area of research, with the potential to revolutionize applications in fields like healthcare, education, and entertainment. By extending RAG to handle and generate multimodal content, researchers are exploring new ways to enhance user interaction and provide more comprehensive and contextually rich information. This includes the development of novel architectures and training paradigms that can effectively handle the increased complexity and variability of multimodal data.</learnings>\n"

There are significant differences in renewable energy development across countries and regions, which requires policymakers to take more precise measures to ensure fair distribution of resources and investments, promoting the balanced development of global renewable energy.\n\nThe key to high-quality development of renewable energy in our country lies in addressing relevant issues and taking effective countermeasures. Specific measures include strengthening technological innovation and infrastructure construction, optimizing the energy structure, improving energy efficiency, and improving related policies and market mechanisms to promote the sustainable development of renewable energy.\n\nAccording to the analysis in 'World Energy Outlook 2024', although renewable energy is growing rapidly, its overall impact on the energy market still needs further observation. The report points out that the rapid growth of renewable energy is gradually changing the structure and dynamics of the energy market, but the dominant position of traditional energy sources is difficult to shake in the short term. Long-term strategic planning and policy support are needed to achieve an energy transition.\nDetermining energy price trends requires a comprehensive consideration of international conditions, including geopolitical conflicts, global economic conditions, and policy changes. These factors influence supply and demand relationships and market expectations, directly or indirectly affecting energy prices. The value distribution and dependency relationships in the global energy industry are complex, with trade relations between major energy exporting and importing countries, technological progress, and the development of alternative energy sources all having a profound impact on price trends. A comprehensive analysis of energy prices not only helps understand market dynamics but also provides decision support for policymakers, businesses, and investors, ensuring energy security and economic stability.\nChina's renewable energy market is undergoing a transformation towards high-quality development, but it faces multiple challenges. According to 'China's Energy Transition: White Paper', despite significant growth in renewable energy capacity, insufficient grid access and consumption capacity have led to serious wind and solar curtailment issues, affecting the economic benefits and market competitiveness of renewable energy. The government is addressing these issues through measures such as optimizing grid layout and advancing power market reforms.\n\nResearch by the Chinese Academy of Sciences indicates that the competitive relationship between renewable energy and traditional energy markets is complex, involving not only price competition but also aspects such as policy support, technological innovation, and market access. With the decline in technology costs and policy support, renewable energy is gradually becoming competitive in certain areas, but it still occupies a small proportion in the overall energy structure and relies on policy support and subsidies.\n\nThe competition between renewable energy and traditional energy markets is also influenced by international factors. China's position in the international renewable energy market is increasingly strong, but it faces challenges from international competition and trade barriers. For example, the United States and the European Union have implemented anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations on China's photovoltaic products, affecting the international market share and competitiveness of Chinese renewable energy companies.\nChina's energy policies have a significant impact on traditional energy prices, especially in the coal and oil sectors. The government can effectively regulate the supply and demand relationship in the energy market through measures such as subsidies, price controls, and market interventions, thereby directly influencing energy prices. For example, in 2019, the Chinese government adjusted the import tariffs on coal, successfully stabilizing domestic coal prices and alleviating the tight energy supply situation.\n\nIn the context of a global energy crisis, China's dependence on energy imports has increased, making it more sensitive to fluctuations in international energy prices. In 2020, due to the global pandemic and geopolitical factors, international oil prices fluctuated significantly, causing China's oil import costs to fluctuate. This dependence makes China's energy prices directly affected by international markets, increasing the uncertainty in the domestic energy market.\n\nEconomic factors such as economic growth and changes in industrial demand have a significant impact on traditional energy prices. China's economic growth rate and level of industrial activity are key factors affecting energy demand. Between 2018 and 2020, China's economic growth slowed and industrial activities decreased, leading to a decline in energy demand, which in turn affected energy prices. Additionally, government efforts to improve energy efficiency and promote clean energy transitions have had a long-term inhibitory effect on the demand for traditional energy.\nChanges in global energy demand lead to fluctuations in traditional energy prices, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries, where rapid growth in energy demand has a significant impact on oil and gas prices. According to the IEA's 'World Energy Outlook 2024', it is expected that by 2030, energy demand in emerging markets will increase by 40%, which will have a significant impact on the global energy market, especially on the pricing mechanism of traditional energy.\n\nGeopolitical factors play a crucial role in influencing global energy demand and traditional energy prices. 'The Century-Long Transformation of the Global Energy Industry and National Energy Security' points out that geopolitical conflicts and tensions, such as instability in the Middle East, can exacerbate energy price volatility. For example, in 2023, a series of conflicts in the Middle East caused global oil prices to rise by 20% in a short period of time.\n\nTechnological progress and the rise of renewable energy pose challenges to traditional energy markets but also provide new opportunities for energy transitions. Analysis in 'The Value Distribution and Dependency Relationships in the Global Energy Industry and Influencing Factors' shows that the cost of renewable energy continues to decline, and it is expected that by 2025, solar and wind power will become the cheapest sources of electricity in most countries. This change will force traditional energy companies to adjust their business models to meet changes in market demand.</learnings>\n"

This was driven by more efficient wind power technologies and larger project developments.\n\nThe cost of photovoltaic (PV) power generation dropped by 82% from 2010 to 2019, making it the renewable energy technology with the most significant cost reduction. This was primarily attributed to a substantial decrease in PV module manufacturing costs and improvements in PV system efficiency.\nThe root cause of global energy supply and demand imbalance lies in the combined effects of multiple factors, including geopolitical tensions, uneven resource distribution, and changes in technology and policy. These factors have led to volatility and uncertainty in energy markets, affecting price stability and predictability.\n\nPrice distortions are a significant reason for the imbalance in electricity markets. Econometric studies show that government subsidies, tax policies, and market interventions can lead to distorted market price signals, affecting the decision-making of both suppliers and consumers, and exacerbating market imbalances.\n\nThe century-long transformation of the world's energy landscape has had a profound impact on national energy security. Research in the Journal of Natural Resources points out that as energy demand continues to grow and supply uncertainty increases, countries face significant challenges in ensuring energy security. They need to address these challenges through diversified energy supplies, technological innovation, and international cooperation.\nGeopolitical conflicts significantly impact traditional energy prices. For example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 led to a surge in international oil prices, with Brent crude reaching $139 per barrel in March 2022, an increase of over 80% compared to the same period in 2021. This conflict not only pushed up oil prices but also increased uncertainty in the global energy market, forcing countries to reassess the security and reliability of their energy supply chains.\n\nThe geopolitical risks posed by North Korea threaten the energy security of Northeast Asia, particularly South Korea and Japan. In 2017, North Korea conducted multiple nuclear tests and missile launches, escalating tensions in the region. South Korea and Japan had to increase energy imports, especially liquefied natural gas (LNG), to ensure stable energy supply. This led to a 30% increase in Asian LNG prices in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nGeopolitical conflicts not only affect energy prices but can also alter the direction and structure of energy trade. For instance, during the 2011 Libyan civil war, the country's oil production almost completely halted, causing a tight supply in the European market. European countries were forced to turn to other sources, such as the North Sea and Russia. This not only pushed up oil prices but also accelerated the restructuring of the European energy market, promoting new energy cooperation and infrastructure construction.\nThe global economic downturn and weak demand will make the outlook for the international oil market in 2025 bleak. Wang Nengquan noted that the current economic situation poses a significant challenge to traditional energy demand, especially in major economies, where trends of economic slowdown and declining energy demand are evident.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA)'s 'World Energy Outlook 2024' report emphasizes the significant impact of the global economic situation on energy prices. The report predicts that if the global economy continues to stagnate, traditional energy prices will remain low, further suppressing investment and production activities.\n\nChanges in energy demand in emerging markets and developing countries will become an important factor influencing the global energy market. The economic growth and industrialization processes of these countries will significantly impact the demand for oil and natural gas, while global economic uncertainty increases the volatility and risk in these markets.\nPolicy support has different impacts on renewable and traditional energy markets, reflected in market structure and investment direction. The Chinese government has promoted high-quality development of renewable energy through a series of policies, such as 'The National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration on Improving the Mechanisms and Systems for Green and Low-Carbon Energy Transition...'. These policies have fostered innovation in renewable energy technologies and expanded market size, but they have also led to a relative decline in the traditional energy market and reduced investment.\n\nTrump's new term energy policies have had a profound impact on the energy landscape of the United States and China. The Trump administration favored fossil fuels and nuclear energy, reducing subsidies and policy support for renewable energy, which slowed the growth of the U.S. renewable energy market while stabilizing the traditional energy market. This policy change also affected China's energy market, prompting China to independently advance the development of renewable energy and reduce its dependence on the U.S. market.\n\nPolicies issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration emphasize improving the mechanisms and systems for green and low-carbon energy transition. This not only promotes the large-scale application of renewable energy but also optimizes the overall energy system. Specific measures include improving the grid integration and consumption capacity of renewable energy, optimizing the energy structure, and enhancing energy utilization efficiency. These initiatives reduce carbon emissions while also increasing the overall competitiveness of the energy market.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Specific measures taken by major countries and regions in energy policy have significantly impacted the structure and dynamics of both traditional and renewable energy markets. For example, China significantly increased its investment in renewable energy in 2021, particularly in wind and solar power, reaching $38 billion. This has driven the rapid development of the domestic renewable energy industry and reduced reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThe transformation of EU energy policy has had a significant impact on the traditional energy market. By implementing a carbon trading system and strict carbon emission standards, the EU has accelerated the transition of energy companies to low-carbon technologies. This has not only increased the market share of renewable energy but also led to a decline in demand for traditional energy sources such as coal and oil, affecting the global energy trade landscape.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, the U.S. relaxed regulations on fossil fuels, but this policy was quickly reversed when Biden took office, with a renewed emphasis on renewable energy development. The Clean Energy Act proposed by the Biden administration plans to invest $2 trillion in clean energy infrastructure, which has not only stimulated the growth of the domestic renewable energy market but also triggered a reconfiguration of global energy investments.\nThe rapid industrialization and urbanization in emerging markets like China and India have significantly increased their energy demand, leading to higher global prices for traditional energy sources such as coal and oil. For instance, China's coal consumption more than doubled between 2000 and 2010, contributing to a 150% increase in global coal prices during the same period.\n\nIn response to rising energy demand and price volatility, several emerging economies have implemented policies to diversify their energy mix, including increased investment in renewable energy. Brazil's Proinfa program, launched in 2002, has facilitated the addition of over 10 GW of renewable energy capacity, reducing the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels and stabilizing domestic energy prices.\n\nThe shift in energy demand from developed to developing countries has also altered the dynamics of global energy trade. For example, Africa's energy exports to Asia have surged, with Nigeria's crude oil exports to China increasing by 300% between 2005 and 2015, reflecting the growing importance of these regions in shaping global energy markets and prices.\nChina is enhancing its ability to absorb renewable energy through the construction of electricity markets and the promotion of distributed photovoltaic development. This includes improving the mechanisms of the electricity market to better accommodate high proportions of renewable energy, thereby reducing issues such as curtailed wind and solar power.\n\nTo effectively enhance the absorption capacity of new energy, China is accelerating the construction and reform of electricity markets. These measures involve not only technological upgrades but also policy support and innovation in market mechanisms to ensure the effective utilization and economic viability of renewable energy.\n\nThe sustainable development path of distributed photovoltaics has become an important means for China to address the issue of renewable energy absorption. By optimizing the layout and operation of distributed photovoltaic systems, China is gradually improving the efficiency of renewable energy utilization and reducing dependence on traditional energy sources.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global oil prices will remain volatile in 2024, influenced by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and OPEC+ production policies. The IEA highlights a significant increase in natural gas prices in Europe and Asia, driven by tight supply conditions and increased demand from the industrial sector. Renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, are expected to see substantial growth, with the IEA projecting a 20% increase in renewable capacity by the end of 2024, driven by policy support and declining technology costs.\nGeopolitical conflicts have led to disruptions and instability in energy supply chains, especially in key energy corridors and production areas such as the Middle East and North Africa. Frequent conflicts in these regions have caused interruptions in oil and gas supplies, leading to volatility and price increases in global energy markets. For example, after the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities in 2019, global oil prices spiked in a short period of time.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have added complexity and uncertainty to the energy transition, affecting investment decisions in both traditional and renewable energy. For example, some countries may delay or cancel investments in traditional energy projects due to geopolitical risks, instead increasing their investment in renewable energy. This shift not only impacts the supply and demand balance in energy markets but can also lead to a long-term downward trend in traditional energy prices.\n\nThe impact of geopolitical conflicts on energy supply chains is also evident in the security and maintenance of transnational energy infrastructure, such as pipelines and transmission lines. These infrastructures often cross multiple politically sensitive regions, facing high security risks. For example, the Ukraine crisis has led to unstable gas pipeline supplies between Russia and Europe, forcing European countries to seek diversified energy supply channels, further affecting the prices and supply-demand relationship in traditional energy markets.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The evolution of the global energy landscape shows that China has played a key role in the energy transition. By increasing investments in renewable energy and reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels, China has become the world's largest producer and consumer of renewable energy. Technological advancements and scaled production in wind and solar power have not only reduced domestic energy costs but also driven down prices in the global renewable energy market, accelerating the global energy transition.\n\nGeopolitical factors significantly influence energy policies, especially in the competition between traditional and renewable energy markets. For example, the economic model of Middle Eastern countries, which relies heavily on oil exports, is being challenged by the rise of renewable energy, leading these countries to adjust their energy policies, promote economic diversification, and increase the use of renewable energy. Meanwhile, European countries, under dual pressures of energy security and environmental protection, have accelerated their transition to renewable energy, reducing their dependence on imported fossil fuels.\n\nAdjustments in energy policies not only impact domestic energy markets but also have far-reaching effects on international energy cooperation and competition. Through the 'Belt and Road' initiative, China actively promotes renewable energy projects in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, enhancing energy security and sustainable development in these regions. In the United States, after the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, the Biden administration rejoined and strengthened support for renewable energy, influencing both U.S. domestic energy policies and reshaping the international energy cooperation landscape.\nThe growing energy demand in emerging markets and developing countries has put significant upward pressure on traditional energy prices. According to the White Paper 'China's Energy Development in the New Era,' between 2010 and 2020, the annual average growth rate of energy consumption in these countries reached 3.5%, far higher than the global average of 1.5%. This surge in demand has led to fluctuations in international oil and coal prices, particularly in 2018 and 2019, when international oil prices rose by 34% and 10%, respectively.\n\nChanges in the energy demand structure in emerging markets are driving structural adjustments in traditional energy prices. The 'World Energy Century Transformation and National Energy Security' points out that with economic development, these countries' demand for clean energy is gradually increasing, but coal and oil remain the primary sources of energy consumption. For instance, India and Southeast Asian countries saw a 20% increase in coal dependency from 2015 to 2020, driving the recovery of international coal prices from $50 per ton in 2016 to $75 per ton in 2020.\n\nThe energy policies and investment trends in emerging markets and developing countries have a significant impact on traditional energy prices. According to the White Paper 'China's Energy Development in the New Era,' the Chinese government invested over 1.5 trillion yuan in energy infrastructure construction from 2016 to 2020, with most of it allocated to traditional energy projects. This not only supported the stability of domestic energy supply but also had spillover effects on the global energy market, particularly in terms of oil and gas import demand, driving up related prices.\nThe trade relations between major energy exporting and importing countries significantly impact traditional energy prices, especially the relationships between exporters such as the Middle East, Russia, and Venezuela, and major importers in Europe and Asia. These countries' energy policies, geopolitical tensions, and supply disruptions can cause price volatility, affecting the stability of the global energy market.\n\nTrade relations between energy exporting and importing countries exhibit significant differences across regions. For example, Asian countries like China and India have a higher dependence on Middle Eastern crude oil, while European countries rely more on Russian natural gas. These regional dependencies not only affect energy prices but also have far-reaching impacts on national energy security and foreign policies.\n\nThe development of emerging markets and technologies is gradually changing the global energy trade landscape, particularly with the popularization of renewable energy and electric vehicles. The promotion of these technologies reduces the demand for traditional energy, challenging the economic models of energy exporting countries and promoting a more sustainable energy structure in energy importing countries.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025, projecting it to reach 103,000 barrels per day. This significant downward adjustment reflects a more cautious outlook on the global economy and energy consumption patterns, potentially impacting investment decisions and market dynamics in the oil sector.\n\nThe 2025 energy market is expected to see a shift towards more sustainable and diversified energy sources, according to FastBull's analysis. This trend is driven by increasing environmental concerns, technological advancements in renewable energy, and policy support from governments worldwide, which could lead to a gradual decline in the dominance of traditional fossil fuels.\n\nThe Peking University Energy Research Institute highlights the profound market implications of the IEA's revised oil demand forecast. This includes potential realignments in supply strategies among major oil-producing countries and companies, as well as adjustments in the pricing mechanisms of oil derivatives and related financial instruments.\nGeopolitical conflicts have led to the restructuring of critical rare earth mineral supply chains, affecting supply security in China and globally. For example, increased Sino-U.S. trade tensions have heightened the supply risks of rare earth minerals, with China, as the world's largest producer, seeing its supply significantly impacted by geopolitical factors, leading to price volatility and supply instability.\n\nThe impact of geopolitical turmoil on the global energy value chain extends beyond price fluctuations to include the diversification and security of supply chains. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused energy supply tensions in Europe, accelerating European countries' reliance on renewable energy and non-Russian energy sources, such as increased imports of liquefied natural gas from the United States and the Middle East, to reduce their dependence on Russian energy.\n\nGeopolitical factors are prompting companies to reassess and adjust their supply chain strategies to enhance resilience against external shocks. For example, many multinational corporations, facing geopolitical risks, are beginning to diversify their production facilities and raw material procurement to reduce reliance on single sources, ensuring the stability and security of their supply chains.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The diversification of energy policies and geopolitical factors significantly impact both traditional and renewable energy markets. For example, China has significantly reduced its reliance on coal by implementing strict environmental policies and making large-scale investments in renewable energy as part of its energy transition efforts. At the same time, China's role in the international energy market has become increasingly important, not only becoming the world's largest investor in renewable energy but also promoting clean energy projects in multiple developing countries through the 'Belt and Road' initiative, enhancing its influence in geopolitics.\n\nThe differences in energy policies among countries have led to the complexity and volatility of the global energy market structure. European countries like Germany and Denmark have successfully promoted the rapid development of wind and solar power by setting ambitious renewable energy targets and providing fiscal subsidies. In contrast, oil-exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, although gradually investing in renewable energy, have seen slow transitions due to the significant interests of their traditional energy industries, leading to notable differences in their positions and strategies in the energy market.\n\nThe formulation and implementation of energy policies have profound impacts on domestic economies and international relations. During the Trump administration, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement and increased support for fossil fuels, leading to widespread criticism of its stance in international climate negotiations. However, after the Biden administration took office, it rejoined the Paris Agreement and launched a series of green new deals, accelerating domestic energy transition and reestablishing the U.S.'s leadership in international climate governance. These policy changes not only affected the U.S. domestic energy market but also had significant impacts on global energy cooperation and geopolitical dynamics.\n\nThe energy demand growth in emerging markets and developing countries, particularly in Asia and Africa, has led to a reallocation of the global energy demand structure. According to the White Paper 'China's Energy Development in the New Era,' between 2010 and 2020, the annual average growth rate of energy demand in emerging markets in Asia reached 3.5%, while in Africa it was 2.8%.\n\nTraditional energy prices are significantly influenced by the energy demand from emerging markets, especially oil and coal. The 'World Energy Century Transformation and National Energy Security' report points out that between 2015 and 2020, due to strong demand from countries like China and India, international oil prices rose from $40 per barrel to $70 per barrel, and coal prices increased from $50 per ton to $80 per ton.\n\nThe rapid development of renewable energy poses challenges to traditional energy markets, but emerging markets and developing countries still rely heavily on traditional energy sources in the short term. The White Paper 'China's Energy Development in the New Era' shows that despite the installed capacity of renewable energy reaching 1,136 GW in 2020, accounting for 30% of the global total, the share of coal and oil in the energy consumption of emerging markets and developing countries remains over 50%.\n\nThe trade relationships between major energy exporting and importing countries have a significant impact on traditional energy prices, especially with the U.S. being the world's largest gasoline importer. Fluctuations in U.S. import demand directly affect international gasoline prices and the stability of the global energy supply chain.\n\nThe dynamic changes in the U.S. gasoline import market amplify the volatility of global energy prices, particularly during periods of tight supply and demand. For example, a sudden increase in U.S. gasoline demand in 2023 led to a more than 10% rise in international oil prices within a short period, further exacerbating the instability of the global energy market.\n\nThe complexity of global energy trade lies in the interplay of geographical distribution and political-economic factors. Trade relationships between major energy exporters like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran and major importers like China, India, and Japan are influenced not only by market supply and demand but also by geopolitical constraints. For instance, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2022 led to an interruption in Russia's gas supply to Europe, further driving up global energy prices.\n\nThe IEA predicts that global oil demand growth will be 1.03 million barrels per day in 2025, a downward revision reflecting the dual impact of slow economic recovery and accelerated energy transition. This forecast is based on a comprehensive analysis of economic activities, policy changes, and the development of new energy technologies in major economies.\n\nThe analysis and trend forecast for international crude oil prices in 2025 show that despite slower demand growth, uncertainties on the supply side (such as geopolitical tensions, policy adjustments by oil-producing countries, and the rise of non-traditional energy) will continue to significantly impact oil prices. Academic research indicates that these factors could lead to price volatility in 2025, but the overall trend is expected to remain within the range of $60-$80 per barrel.\n\nThe bi-weekly news report of the Institute of Energy at Peking University for the 6th issue of 2025 covered several important events related to energy, including policy adjustments by major oil-producing countries, breakthroughs in new energy technologies, and the latest developments in the international energy market. These events further validate the forecasts of the IEA and academic journals, emphasizing the impact of the complexity and volatility of the energy market on price trends.\nGeopolitical conflicts have led to the restructuring of key rare earth mineral supply chains. For example, Sino-U.S. trade tensions have prompted China to strengthen its control and processing capabilities of domestic rare earth resources, while the U.S. seeks to diversify its rare earth supply sources to reduce dependence on China.\n\nGeopolitical events have a significant impact on the global energy value chain. For instance, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused a gas supply shortage in Europe, forcing the EU to accelerate its energy transition, increase the proportion of renewable energy and nuclear energy, and seek new gas supply channels, such as importing liquefied natural gas from Qatar and the U.S.\n\nGeopolitical risks have a profound impact on the supply chain security of strategic resources. Studies show that the supply chain concentration of key mineral resources makes them vulnerable to geopolitical risks. For example, the cobalt supply from the Democratic Republic of Congo and the lithium supply from Australia play crucial roles in the global battery industry, and any political instability could trigger supply chain disruptions.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>Saudi Arabia's economic transformation plan 'Vision 2030' aims to reduce dependence on oil by diversifying the economy, developing non-oil sectors, and attracting foreign investment. The plan includes a series of specific measures, such as developing renewable energy, promoting private sector growth, increasing female labor participation, and improving the education system. Although initial progress has been made, such as GDP growth in the non-oil sector and increased foreign direct investment, achieving comprehensive transformation still faces significant challenges, including structural economic issues and geopolitical risks.\n\nDubai's successful economic transformation provides valuable lessons for other Middle Eastern countries. By diversifying its economy, particularly in tourism, financial services, and logistics, Dubai has successfully reduced its reliance on oil revenues. Its innovative policies and infrastructure development, such as the World Trade Center and international airport, have attracted substantial international investment and talent. Dubai's experience shows that through strategic planning and execution, Middle Eastern countries can achieve deep economic restructuring.\n\nThe current status of economic transformation in Middle Eastern oil-producing countries shows that while some progress has been made, there are significant differences in speed and effectiveness. For example, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have made notable progress in the contribution of non-oil sectors to GDP, while other countries like Iran and Iraq still face significant economic transformation pressures. These differences reflect the varying effectiveness of policy implementation, resource allocation, and responses to external environments.\n\nThe application of the resource curse theory in Middle Eastern oil-producing countries indicates that despite abundant oil resources, these countries face significant challenges in economic diversification and sustainable development. For instance, countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran's heavy reliance on oil revenues has led to a single economic structure and lagging development in non-oil sectors. This dependency makes these countries highly vulnerable to international oil price fluctuations, affecting macroeconomic stability.\n\nThe resource curse in Middle Eastern countries also manifests in political and social dimensions. Centralized control of oil resources often reinforces the power of the elite class, leading to closed political systems and corruption. For example, oil wealth in countries like Venezuela and Iraq has not translated into improved living standards but has instead exacerbated social inequality and political instability. This phenomenon not only hinders democratization but also leads to social unrest and widespread dissatisfaction among the population.\n\nThe resource curse theory also highlights environmental sustainability challenges. Oil extraction and production activities in Middle Eastern countries have caused severe environmental damage, including land degradation, water pollution, and air pollution. For example, the oil industry in countries like Kuwait and the UAE has led to serious ecological problems, affecting the health and quality of life of local residents. This environmental cost further undermines the long-term development potential of these countries.\nOne of the main challenges in the economic transformation of Middle Eastern oil-producing countries is the difficulty in implementing economic diversification. These countries have long relied on oil revenues, leading to underdevelopment in other sectors. For example, the non-oil sector's share of GDP in Saudi Arabia is relatively low, and the transformation process requires substantial investment and policy support to promote the development of manufacturing, services, and high-tech industries.\n\nMiddle Eastern countries face human resource and skill shortages during their economic transformation. Due to issues with the education system and labor market structure, these countries struggle to cultivate high-quality talent. For example, although the UAE and Qatar have increased investment in education, they still face a shortage of technical talent, especially in high-tech and innovation fields. This requires long-term educational reform and skills training programs to address.\n\nEconomic transformation is also influenced by external economic conditions and geopolitical factors. Economic transformation plans in Middle Eastern countries, such as Saudi Arabia's 'Vision 2030', are constrained by global economic volatility and geopolitical tensions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the Ukraine crisis in 2022 had a significant impact on the global energy market, causing oil price fluctuations that affected these countries' fiscal revenues and transformation processes. Therefore, these countries need to consider external risks when formulating transformation strategies to enhance economic resilience and adaptability.\nEfforts to diversify the economy in Saudi Arabia aim to reduce dependence on oil, but progress has been slow, partly because the high profits from oil income have reduced the motivation for structural reforms. Although the Saudi government has launched the 'Vision 2030' plan to promote the development of non-oil sectors, the actual effects have not yet fully materialized, and economic transformation still faces many challenges, including the adaptability of the education system and the flexibility of the labor market.\n\nHosting major international events, such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, has attracted significant investment and infrastructure development, but it has also brought heavy financial burdens and resource allocation issues. Large investments may stimulate short-term economic growth, but if they do not effectively translate into sustainable economic structures and diversified sources of income, they may exacerbate economic fragility and dependency.\n\nThe profound influence of Islam in Middle Eastern countries not only affects social and cultural aspects but also imposes important constraints on economic transformation. Religious traditions and customs limit women's economic participation and social status, affecting the diversity and efficiency of the labor market. Additionally, religious factors may complicate policy formulation and implementation, making economic reform measures more complex and difficult.\nDiversification efforts in Saudi Arabia, as outlined in Vision 2030, have led to significant investments in non-oil sectors such as tourism, entertainment, and renewable energy, resulting in a 12% increase in non-oil GDP from 2016 to 2021. However, the pace of private sector job creation has been slower than anticipated, with only a 6% increase in private sector employment over the same period, highlighting the ongoing challenges in reducing the country's reliance on public sector jobs.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates' economic transformation, particularly in Abu Dhabi, has been driven by strategic investments in technology and innovation hubs like the Masdar City project and the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO). These initiatives have attracted significant foreign direct investment, with ADIO securing over $1 billion in new investments in 2022 alone. Despite these successes, the Emirate faces challenges in fully integrating these high-tech sectors into the broader economy, as evidenced by the slow adoption of advanced technologies in traditional industries.\n\nKuwait's economic diversification efforts, while ambitious, have been hindered by political and bureaucratic hurdles, leading to delays in key projects and reforms. The Kuwait National Development Plan, launched in 2010, aimed to diversify the economy and reduce oil dependency by 50% by 2035. However, progress has been limited, with oil still accounting for over 90% of government revenue as of 2022. This highlights the critical role of political stability and effective governance in the success of economic transformation initiatives.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>One of the main obstacles facing Middle Eastern oil-producing countries in their economic transformation is structural economic dependence. Long-term reliance on oil revenues has led to a single economic structure in these countries, lacking diversified industries. For example, despite launching the 'Vision 2030' plan aimed at reducing dependence on oil, Saudi Arabia's oil revenue still accounts for more than 70% of its fiscal income. This dependency makes the process of economic transformation slow and difficult to achieve fundamental changes in the short term.\n\nMiddle Eastern oil-producing countries also face challenges in education and human resources. Although these countries have increased investment in education, the education system still leans towards traditional subjects, lacking training in modern technology and innovation fields. For example, the UAE and Kuwait have made significant investments in higher education, but there is still a shortage of technical talent and innovative entrepreneurs. This further hinders the development of emerging industries and limits the process of economic diversification.\n\nMiddle Eastern oil-producing countries also face geopolitical and security risks in their economic transformation. The region where these countries are located has complex geopolitical situations, with frequent conflicts and instability posing threats to economic transformation. For example, the ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Syria not only affect the economic development of these countries themselves but also impact neighboring countries such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan. These geopolitical risks increase the uncertainty of investment, hindering the inflow of foreign direct investment, thus affecting the process of economic transformation.\nDubai has successfully transformed through a diversified economic strategy, becoming a financial, tourism, and logistics hub in the Middle East. The Dubai government has invested in multiple non-oil sectors, such as real estate, aviation, and financial services, which now account for the majority of Dubai's GDP. Additionally, Dubai has attracted foreign direct investment by establishing free trade zones and offering tax incentives, further promoting economic diversification.\n\nSaudi Arabia's 'Vision 2030' plan aims to reduce dependence on oil by achieving economic diversification through development in various sectors. The plan includes investing in renewable energy, tourism, and entertainment industries, as well as increasing private sector participation. Saudi Arabia has also launched the 'National Transformation Program 2020' as a short-term goal of 'Vision 2030', with specific measures including increasing non-oil exports, raising female labor force participation, and improving the education system.\n\nThe international energy transition presents new challenges and opportunities for Middle Eastern oil-producing countries. With the global demand for renewable energy increasing, Middle Eastern countries are beginning to explore new growth points, such as solar and wind energy. For example, Masdar City in the UAE is committed to becoming a leading global sustainable city, attracting substantial international investment and innovative enterprises.\n\nThe economic transformations of Dubai and Saudi Arabia demonstrate that a diversified strategy is necessary but requires long-term planning and continuous government support. Dubai has successfully reduced its dependence on oil by developing non-oil sectors such as financial services, tourism, and real estate, becoming a regional business center. In contrast, Saudi Arabia's transformation is slower, despite launching the 'Vision 2030' plan, encountering resistance in implementation, including insufficient private sector development and the complexity of the economic structure.\n\nThe post-oil era will see a historic reshaping of the Middle Eastern economic order, accelerated by the international energy transition. The decline in energy demand and the rise of renewable energy have had a significant impact on the economic structure and fiscal revenue of Middle Eastern oil-producing countries. These countries need to reconsider their economic models, moving from reliance on oil exports to a more sustainable economic foundation, including the development of high-value-added industries such as technology, education, and healthcare.\n\nPolitical and social factors play a crucial role in the economic transformation of Middle Eastern oil-producing countries. Political stability and government support are essential prerequisites for successful transformation, while public acceptance and participation are also critical. For example, Saudi Arabia's 'Vision 2030' plan not only requires government promotion but also active participation from the private sector and the public to achieve economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia is actively exploring cooperation with Middle Eastern countries in its economic transformation, particularly in the diversification of the energy sector, including the introduction and application of renewable energy and clean energy technologies, aiming to reduce dependence on traditional oil resources and enhance the sustainability and environmental friendliness of the economy.\n\nThe UAE has made significant progress in promoting sustainable development in clean energy, through the construction of large-scale solar and wind projects, such as the Noor Abu Dhabi solar power station in Abu Dhabi, one of the world's largest single-unit solar power stations with a capacity of 1.18 gigawatts, significantly reducing carbon emissions and enhancing the green level of the energy structure.\n\nChina-Arab energy cooperation is deepening in multiple dimensions, not limited to traditional oil trade, but also including technology transfer, project investment, joint research and development, among others. Chinese companies play a significant role in clean energy projects in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, providing strong support for both sides' economic transformation and environmental sustainability.\n\nIn the process of promoting economic diversification, many Middle Eastern countries have strengthened cooperation with China, which is reflected not only in deepened cooperation in the energy sector but also in infrastructure construction, trade investment, and cultural exchange. China's 'Belt and Road' initiative provides a new platform for cooperation for Middle Eastern countries, promoting regional connectivity and economic integration, and providing multi-faceted support for the economic transformation of Middle Eastern countries.\n\nInternational support and cooperation mechanisms have played a key role in the economic transformation of Middle Eastern countries, especially through the involvement of multilateral institutions and international organizations, providing technical and financial support to these countries. Projects funded by institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in infrastructure construction, education, and healthcare have enhanced the economic resilience and sustainable development capabilities of Middle Eastern countries.</learnings>\n"

These initiatives have not only created new job opportunities but also improved the quality of life for citizens.\n\nThe UAE has also made significant progress in economic transformation through the implementation of the 'Centennial 2071' and 'Vision 2021' plans. The country has successfully attracted substantial foreign investment by developing renewable energy, high-tech industries, and financial services. The UAE has further promoted economic diversification by establishing multiple free trade zones, such as the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). These measures have made the UAE one of the most competitive economies in the Middle East.\n\nQatar has achieved economic diversification through the 'National Vision 2030' plan, making significant progress particularly in natural gas, finance, and tourism. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) has made large-scale investments globally, not only supporting the domestic economy but also enhancing international influence. Additionally, Qatar has boosted its national image and attractiveness by hosting major international events, such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup. These measures have not only raised Qatar's international status but also laid a solid foundation for sustained economic growth.\nInternational support and cooperation mechanisms have facilitated the diversification of economies in Middle Eastern oil-producing countries by providing technical assistance and financial resources, enabling them to invest in renewable energy and other non-oil sectors. For instance, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has played a crucial role in promoting renewable energy projects in countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, leading to significant increases in solar and wind energy capacity.\n\nThe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have provided loans and grants to support economic reforms and infrastructure development in Middle Eastern oil-producing countries. These financial resources have been essential in implementing structural reforms aimed at reducing dependency on oil revenues and fostering a more resilient and diversified economy. For example, the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF) has supported economic stabilization and reform programs in countries like Jordan and Egypt.\n\nRegional cooperation initiatives, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), have enhanced economic integration and collaboration among Middle Eastern countries, facilitating the exchange of best practices and joint investment in strategic sectors. This has led to the establishment of regional energy grids and the development of cross-border infrastructure projects, which are crucial for the economic transformation and sustainable development of the region.\nEducational reforms in Saudi Arabia have significantly increased women's participation in education, with the proportion of women in higher education exceeding 50% in 2017. The government has successfully improved women's educational levels and employment rates by providing scholarships, establishing specialized women's educational institutions and vocational training centers, and promoting policies that encourage women's employment. These measures have not only promoted gender equality in society but also provided important human resource support for the country's economic diversification and sustainable development.\n\nQatar has significantly increased investment in education and training, particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education, through the implementation of the 'National Vision 2030' strategy. Between 2015 and 2020, public spending on STEM education in Qatar grew by 40%, and multiple international educational cooperation projects were established, including branch campuses of world-renowned universities. These initiatives have significantly improved the scientific and technological literacy of Qatari youth, laying a solid foundation for the country's innovation and high-tech industry development.\n\nThe UAE has focused on developing vocational education and skills training, especially in information technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, through the 'UAE Vision 2021' and 'National Skills Strategy'. In 2019, the UAE government launched the 'Future Skills Academy' project, aiming to cultivate a workforce equipped with key future skills. Additionally, the UAE has improved the international competitiveness and adaptability of its workforce by collaborating with international educational institutions to introduce advanced training models and technologies.\nGulf Arab countries have taken several concrete measures to promote environmental sustainability, such as Saudi Arabia's 'Green Initiative' plan, which aims to plant 10 billion trees and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. The plan also includes constructing solar and wind power plants to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and increase the share of renewable energy.\n\nMasdar City in the UAE is a global pioneer in zero-carbon emission city projects, which has made significant progress since its launch in 2006. Masdar City integrates advanced renewable energy technologies, such as solar power and smart grids, while promoting low-carbon building standards and green transportation systems, setting an example for sustainable urban development.\n\nDuring the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Qatar implemented several environmental measures, including using renewable energy-powered stadiums, efficient water management, and waste recycling systems. These measures not only reduced the environmental impact of the event but also demonstrated Qatar's capability in sustainable management of large-scale events.</learnings>\n"

These findings will cover all major aspects to ensure the completeness and logic of the content.</think><answer>- The slow progress of economic transformation in Middle Eastern oil-producing countries is not only due to the resource curse but also influenced by structural economic dependence. These countries have long relied on oil revenues, resulting in a single economic structure and a lack of diversified industries.\n- Saudi Arabia's 'Vision 2030' plan has made some progress, such as GDP growth in non-oil sectors and increased foreign direct investment, but it still faces significant challenges including structural economic issues and geopolitical risks.\n- The successful transformation case of Dubai shows that through strategic planning and execution, Middle Eastern countries can achieve deep economic restructuring. However, this requires long-term planning and continuous government support.\n- Middle Eastern countries face human resource and skill shortages during their economic transformation, with inadequacies in education systems and labor market structures limiting the development of high-quality talent and hindering the growth of new industries.\n- Geopolitical and security risks pose threats to the economic transformation of Middle Eastern oil-producing countries. Frequent conflicts and instability increase investment uncertainty and hinder the inflow of foreign direct investment.\n- International support and cooperation mechanisms have played a crucial role in the economic transformation of Middle Eastern countries. By providing technical and financial support, these mechanisms help these countries invest in renewable energy and other non-oil sectors.\n- The resource curse in Middle Eastern countries also manifests in political and social dimensions. The centralized control of oil resources often reinforces the power of the elite class, leading to closed political systems and corruption, which hinders the implementation of economic reforms.\n- Middle Eastern countries face challenges in education and human resources during their economic transformation. Despite increased investment in education, the education system remains biased towards traditional subjects and lacks focus on modern technology and innovation.\n- The global energy transition presents new challenges and opportunities for Middle Eastern oil-producing countries. With increasing global demand for renewable energy, these countries are beginning to explore new growth points, such as solar and wind energy.\n- Hosting large international events in Middle Eastern countries has attracted substantial investment and infrastructure development, but it has also brought heavy financial burdens and resource allocation issues, potentially exacerbating economic fragility and dependency.</answer>"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The success of live streaming e-commerce in China is attributed to its highly developed mobile internet infrastructure and a large user base. The widespread adoption of mobile internet in China, with extensive 4G and 5G network coverage, has enabled live streaming e-commerce to spread rapidly and reach a vast number of users. Additionally, the large number of smartphone users in China provides a strong foundation for live streaming e-commerce.\n\nThe success of live streaming e-commerce in China is also due to its unique social e-commerce ecosystem. Platforms such as Taobao Live, Douyin, and Kuaishou not only offer a wide range of live content but also enhance user engagement through social interactions and community building. These platforms use algorithmic recommendations to match user interests precisely, thereby increasing conversion rates and user participation.\n\nThe success of live streaming e-commerce in China is further supported by government policies and regulatory environment. The Chinese government has a positive attitude towards e-commerce and live streaming e-commerce, implementing a series of supportive policies that have driven industry growth. At the same time, the government plays a crucial role in regulating market order and protecting consumer rights, providing a safeguard for the healthy development of the industry.\nA key factor contributing to the slow development of live streaming e-commerce in other markets is the difference in regulatory environments. Regulatory policies in different countries and regions vary in their restrictions on live streaming e-commerce, which directly affects the promotion and acceptance of this model. For example, strict reviews of advertising content and high requirements for host qualifications in some countries make it difficult for live streaming e-commerce to gain rapid popularity.\n\nAnother factor is the differences in consumer habits and trust levels. In some markets, consumers have lower acceptance of live streaming e-commerce, mainly due to a lack of trust and concerns about product quality. Compared to traditional shopping methods, the immediacy and interactivity of live streaming e-commerce add fun to the shopping experience but also bring more uncertainty and risk, especially regarding product quality and after-sales service.\n\nMoreover, sustainability issues are another important reason for the slow development of live streaming e-commerce in other markets. In some markets, the live streaming e-commerce model relies heavily on the personal influence of major hosts, and the sustainability of this model is questioned. The personal risks and dependencies of major hosts can lead to market instability, affecting the long-term development of live streaming e-commerce.\nThe live streaming e-commerce market in China has already formed a trillion-yuan scale, demonstrating strong consumer potential. According to relevant reports, the live streaming e-commerce market in China reached 1.05 trillion yuan in 2020, growing by 400% year-over-year, and is expected to continue to grow rapidly in 2021. Behind this phenomenon is the rapid rise of live streaming platforms such as Taobao Live, Douyin, and Kuaishou, which have significantly enhanced the shopping experience and purchasing intent of consumers through host interactions and recommendations.\n\nIn international markets, although live streaming e-commerce is gradually gaining attention, its development speed and scale are far behind the Chinese market. Consumers in developed countries like Europe and America have lower acceptance of live streaming e-commerce, mainly due to cultural differences, trust issues, and the quality of live content production. Furthermore, the investment and optimization of live streaming functions by e-commerce platforms and social media platforms in international markets are relatively low, limiting the popularity and development of live streaming e-commerce in these markets.\n\nWhen sellers engage in overseas live streaming e-commerce, they must pay special attention to local laws and regulations to avoid marketing failures caused by cultural differences and legal issues. For example, advertising standards differ across countries, and promotional methods allowed in some countries may be considered violations in others. Additionally, language barriers and time zone differences are challenges that sellers need to overcome, as these factors can affect the effectiveness of live streams and audience participation.\nLive streaming e-commerce has significantly increased consumers' willingness to purchase through the influence of influencers, especially among young consumers. Influencer recommendations and live interactions can quickly stimulate purchasing impulses and improve conversion rates. For instance, a well-known influencer recommended a cosmetic product during a live stream, and sales exceeded 100,000 units within 30 minutes, demonstrating the strong selling power of live streaming e-commerce.\n\nLive streaming e-commerce not only boosts sales but also changes the shopping experience. Through real-time interaction and visual demonstrations, consumers can better understand product features and usage effects, enhancing trust and purchase confidence. This new shopping method reduces consumers' doubts about product quality and improves the efficiency of purchase decisions, particularly in the luxury and high-end markets.\n\nAs an emerging marketing model, live streaming e-commerce is not just a simple product sale but also a process of 'product aesthetics education.' During live streams, influencers not only introduce products but also teach usage techniques and styling suggestions, helping consumers improve their aesthetic and consumption tastes. This educational function makes live streaming e-commerce more than just a transaction; it becomes a guide to a lifestyle, influencing consumers' consumption concepts and behavior patterns.\nIn the selection of live streaming e-commerce platforms, Huixin, as a technology provider, offers various tools and solutions to support the efficient operation and user interaction of live streaming e-commerce. Huixin's live streaming tools not only cover basic live streaming functions but also integrate advanced features such as instant messaging, interactive voting, and bullet screen interactions, providing comprehensive technical support for live streaming e-commerce.\n\nNew trends have emerged in the live streaming e-commerce sector, requiring more standardized management. According to a report by Guangming Daily, the rapid growth of live streaming e-commerce has brought regulatory lags, including challenges related to product quality, false advertising, and after-sales service. The industry needs stricter regulations and standards to ensure consumer rights and the healthy development of the market.\n\nThe technical support for live streaming e-commerce is not limited to the live streaming platforms themselves but also includes data analysis, user behavior tracking, supply chain management, and other integrated technologies. The comprehensive application of these technologies not only enhances the operational efficiency of live streaming e-commerce but also provides merchants with more precise marketing strategies and user insights.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The long-term development of China's semiconductor industry is significantly influenced by geopolitical factors, especially in the context of U.S. technology export controls and supply chain restrictions on China. China needs to strengthen its self-research and development capabilities and reduce its dependence on foreign technologies and equipment. For example, U.S. export control policies have already led to severe challenges for China in the high-end chip manufacturing sector, which has prompted China to increase investment in various segments of the semiconductor industry, particularly in key areas such as materials, equipment, and design software.\n\nThe geopolitical nature of the semiconductor industry has intensified, partly due to the increasingly fierce technological competition among major global economies, especially the tech war between the U.S. and China. This competition extends beyond market competition to include aspects such as technical standards, talent mobility, and intellectual property protection. For instance, the U.S. restricts China's access to advanced technologies and equipment to maintain its global leadership in semiconductors, while China strengthens its domestic industry and international cooperation to break through technological blockades.\n\nThe impact of geopolitical factors on the semiconductor industry also manifests in the trend of restructuring and diversification of international supply chains. To reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions caused by political risks, countries and companies are actively adjusting their supply chain layouts, seeking alternative suppliers and production bases. For example, Taiwan, a global hub for semiconductor production and R&D, faces increasing geopolitical pressure from both mainland China and the U.S., forcing Taiwanese companies to consider establishing production bases in other regions to diversify risks.\nThe geopolitical tensions have led to the reconfiguration of the global semiconductor supply chain, with companies actively adjusting their production and procurement strategies to reduce dependence on specific countries or regions. For example, trade frictions between the U.S. and China have prompted many companies to establish new production bases in Southeast Asia and India to diversify risks and ensure supply chain stability.\n\nGeopolitical factors have had a significant impact on the supply and demand relationship in the semiconductor market, particularly in the acquisition of key raw materials and equipment. For example, Japan's export restrictions on South Korea have exacerbated tensions in the global semiconductor materials market, forcing South Korean companies to seek alternative suppliers to avoid production interruptions and cost increases.\n\nUnder geopolitical pressures, issues related to technology transfer and intellectual property protection have become more prominent, affecting innovation and collaboration in the global semiconductor industry. U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech companies not only limit their international expansion but also accelerate China's indigenous technological innovation and self-sufficiency, driving the development of the domestic semiconductor industry.\nGlobal technological development is accelerating, and the influence of geopolitical factors in the semiconductor industry is growing, leading to increased complexity in technology iteration and market layout. Technological changes are reshaping the global innovation landscape, and the geopolitical attributes of the semiconductor industry not only affect the strategic decisions of multinational corporations but also trigger technological competition and trade friction between nations. The geographic concentration and fragility of the semiconductor supply chain have increased the uncertainty of global innovation efficiency, especially the trend of technological decoupling between China and the U.S., which poses significant challenges to the stability and innovation efficiency of the global semiconductor supply chain.</learnings>\n"

This principle holds a significant position in international climate negotiations, ensuring the fairness and feasibility of emission reduction actions.\n\nAchieving the carbon neutrality goal not only depends on national-level policies and actions but also requires collaboration and support from the international community. Developed countries should take more responsibility in technology transfer, financial assistance, and capacity building to help developing countries achieve green and low-carbon transitions while ensuring the realization of global emission reduction targets.\n\nThe allocation mechanism for carbon emission rights is a key component in achieving the carbon neutrality goal, requiring a comprehensive consideration of historical emissions, population size, economic development levels, and emission reduction potential. A reasonable allocation mechanism can promote the fairness and effectiveness of global emission reduction actions, avoiding uneven distribution of reduction burdens due to unfair allocation.\nDeveloped countries' historical responsibility for climate change makes them bear more emission reduction obligations, while developing countries are often seen as victims, needing support and adaptation measures.\nChina has taken proactive policies and actions in addressing climate change, emphasizing its development rights and the importance of global cooperation, demonstrating its firm determination towards the carbon neutrality goal.\nThe principle of common but differentiated responsibilities remains at the core of international climate negotiations, with developing countries advocating for differentiated responsibility allocation based on their capabilities and historical responsibilities in achieving the carbon neutrality goal.\nThe lack of trust from developed countries towards the Global South in climate issues needs to be addressed. Historically, developed countries have emitted far more carbon than Global South countries, but they have failed to fulfill their commitments in providing financial and technological support, leading to significant challenges for the Global South in addressing climate change.\n\nDeveloped countries must quickly honor their climate finance commitments. According to the China Environment News, developed countries committed in the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Conference to provide $100 billion annually by 2020, but this target has yet to be achieved, severely impacting the progress of global climate action.\n\nDeveloped countries should strengthen technology and knowledge transfer to support the Global South in achieving the carbon neutrality goal. In addition to financial support, developed countries should provide advanced low-carbon technologies and expertise to help the Global South enhance capacity building and achieve sustainable development. This not only helps realize global climate goals but also promotes the green transformation of the global economy. The principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities' in international climate agreements emphasizes the differences in carbon neutrality responsibilities between developed and developing countries. This principle is clearly reflected in the Paris Agreement, which requires developed countries to provide financial, technological, and capacity-building support to help developing countries achieve mitigation and adaptation goals. For example, developed countries have committed to providing $100 billion annually in climate financing by 2020, but this target has not been fully met.\n\nThe 'principle of justice' in international just transition policies emphasizes ensuring social equity and economic justice in the process of carbon neutrality. This principle requires that the impact on low-income and vulnerable groups be fully considered during the implementation of emission reduction measures, avoiding adverse effects due to energy transitions. For example, the EU's 'Just Transition Fund' aims to support regions and industries most affected by carbon neutrality policies through financial support and skills training, helping these areas achieve economic transformation.\n\nThere are significant differences in responsibility allocation in international climate agreements, leading to imbalances in carbon neutrality actions among countries. For example, some developed countries have set clear carbon neutrality goals and taken specific actions, such as the EU's plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, while some developing countries face dual constraints of funding and technology, making it difficult to formulate and implement specific carbon neutrality plans. This imbalance needs to be addressed through international coordination and cooperation to ensure the realization of global carbon neutrality goals.</learnings>\n"

This principle emphasizes that developed countries should take on more responsibility for emission reduction and provide financial and technical support to help developing countries achieve a low-carbon transition. For example, the EU and the US have established green funds and provided technical assistance to support renewable energy projects in African and Southeast Asian countries, which not only promotes sustainable development in these countries but also creates new market opportunities for themselves.\n\nThe differences in low-carbon development levels among global cities provide valuable lessons for international cooperation. By comparing the low-carbon development paths of over a hundred cities worldwide, it can be observed that cities in developed countries lead in energy efficiency, green buildings, and public transportation, while cities in developing countries excel in renewable energy and adaptive measures. This complementarity provides a foundation for city-to-city cooperation, such as the collaboration between Chinese and European cities on green buildings and smart transportation systems, and joint research between Indian and American cities on renewable energy projects.\n\nInternational cooperation under the goal of carbon neutrality requires support from various mechanisms and platforms. For instance, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provide important financial and technical support to developing countries. Additionally, international organizations and non-governmental organizations play a key role in promoting South-South and North-South cooperation, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank's green financing projects, and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)'s technology transfer programs. These mechanisms not only promote the realization of global carbon neutrality goals but also provide specific implementation pathways and best practices for countries.\nCOP28 made significant progress in climate finance, particularly in promoting the green and low-carbon transformation of the 'Belt and Road' initiative, emphasizing the critical role of multilateral financial institutions and the private sector in providing necessary funding and supporting technology transfer.\n\nAt the exchange meeting on the green and low-carbon transformation of the 'Belt and Road', participants discussed how to promote the low-carbon transition of developing countries through green finance and sustainable investment, proposing specific recommendations for establishing green finance standards and policy frameworks to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of funding.\n\nIn the progress and outlook of global climate action, experts unanimously agreed that future efforts need to strengthen international cooperation, especially in technology, finance, and capacity building, to support developing countries in addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development goals. Technology transfer and capacity building play a crucial role in helping developing countries achieve their carbon neutrality goals. At the high-level meeting of BRICS countries on climate change, all parties emphasized the importance of technology transfer and capacity building, considering it a key path to achieving carbon neutrality. By strengthening technological cooperation and knowledge sharing, developing countries can more quickly access and apply advanced low-carbon technologies, thus accelerating their green transition process.\n\nAt the ninth Multilateral Conference on Science and Technology Innovation for Sustainable Development, Minister Yin Hejun of China's Ministry of Science and Technology emphasized the central role of scientific and technological innovation in achieving carbon neutrality. He pointed out that through technological innovation and international cooperation, the ability of developing countries to address climate change can be effectively enhanced. Specific measures include establishing technology transfer platforms, providing technical training and financial support, and strengthening policy coordination and planning to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of technology transfer.\n\nTechnology transfer and capacity building not only involve the transfer of hardware technology but also the construction of soft capabilities, such as policy formulation, project management, and technology evaluation. The joint statement of BRICS countries specifically mentioned the need to establish a comprehensive capacity-building framework to ensure the smooth progress of technology transfer. This includes setting up specialized training centers, formulating standardized technology evaluation and certification systems, and establishing multilateral cooperation mechanisms to promote the transparency and sharing of technology information.\nDeveloping countries face dual constraints of funding and technology in achieving carbon neutrality. These countries often lack sufficient financial resources and advanced low-carbon technologies, making it difficult for them to keep pace with developed countries in emission reduction and transition. For example, many developing countries lag significantly in the development and application of clean energy technologies, which not only limits their emission reduction capabilities but also affects the potential for sustainable economic development.\n\nInternational support and cooperation are key to addressing the carbon neutrality challenges faced by developing countries. Through international financial and technology transfer, these countries can effectively overcome funding and technology barriers. For example, international institutions such as the UNFCCC and the GCF have played an important role in providing financial support and technical assistance, but this support remains insufficient and needs to be further strengthened and optimized.\n\nAchieving carbon neutrality in developing countries requires comprehensive policy and institutional safeguards. When formulating and implementing carbon neutrality policies, these countries need to consider their specific economic, social, and environmental contexts to ensure the feasibility and effectiveness of the policies. For example, China has promoted carbon neutrality through measures such as establishing a national carbon trading market, implementing a carbon emission quota system, and promoting green finance, providing useful references and experiences for other developing countries.</learnings>\n"

Through the synergistic effects of federal and state-level policies, the development of the hydrogen industry can be promoted. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) launched the 'Hydrogen Program' in 2021, aiming to reduce hydrogen costs and enhance its competitiveness in the energy system through R&D, demonstration projects, and market promotion.\n\nDeveloping countries should draw lessons from Chinese companies' carbon neutrality strategies in achieving their carbon neutrality goals. By formulating specific and feasible emission reduction paths and technological innovations, they can achieve sustainable development. Chinese companies not only focus on reducing emissions within their internal operations but also promote carbon reduction across the entire supply chain through supply chain management and product design. For instance, BYD's innovations and applications in the new energy vehicle sector have significantly reduced carbon emissions in the transportation sector.\n\nThe implementation of global carbon neutrality policies should follow the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities.' Developing countries should receive international financial and technological support to overcome resource and capability constraints. For example, developed countries should provide necessary financial and technological assistance to developing countries through mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), helping them establish low-carbon economic systems.\nIn specific cases of international cooperation under carbon neutrality goals, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) provides important successful experiences. Since its launch in 2005, the EU ETS has significantly reduced carbon emissions in the industrial and energy sectors through a cap-and-trade mechanism. By 2020, emissions covered by the EU ETS had decreased by about 35%. The success of this mechanism lies in its clear legal framework, strict monitoring and reporting requirements, and severe penalties for violations.\n\nCalifornia's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) demonstrates the flexibility and effectiveness of carbon neutrality policies at the local level. The LCFS incentivizes fuel suppliers to adopt cleaner alternative fuels, such as biodiesel and electric vehicle fuels, by setting fuel carbon intensity standards. Since its implementation in 2011, the LCFS has reduced approximately 30 million tons of CO2 emissions and promoted innovation and investment in low-carbon technologies. The success of this policy lies in its utilization of market mechanisms and encouragement of innovation.\n\nInternational cooperation is essential in achieving carbon neutrality goals, and the signing and implementation of the Paris Agreement is a typical example. The signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 marked a commitment by 196 countries and regions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, gradually achieving carbon neutrality goals through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The success of the Paris Agreement lies in its global participation, flexible NDC mechanism, and transparency in regular assessments and updates of targets.\nDeveloping countries face dual constraints of funding and technology in achieving their carbon neutrality goals. Due to the leading position of developed countries in carbon neutrality technology research and application, developing countries often rely on external financial and technological support. For example, green funds and technology transfer agreements provided by international financial institutions and developed countries are important pathways for developing countries to achieve their carbon neutrality goals.\n\nDeveloping countries face policy and institutional barriers in planning their carbon neutrality paths. Many developing countries lack systematic and continuous carbon neutrality policies, leading to significant discounts in policy implementation effectiveness. For example, frequent policy changes, lack of long-term planning, and coordination mechanisms make it difficult for businesses and investors to navigate the green transition, affecting the realization of carbon neutrality goals.\n\nDeveloping countries need to balance economic development with environmental sustainability in achieving their carbon neutrality goals. Many developing countries are still in the rapid stages of industrialization and urbanization, with high dependence on high-carbon emissions for economic growth. Therefore, while promoting carbon neutrality, developing countries need to take measures to promote economic structural transformation, such as developing low-carbon industries, improving energy efficiency, and promoting renewable energy, to achieve a win-win between economic development and environmental protection.\nThe United Nations is actively promoting sustainable development and climate action, focusing on achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals through various initiatives and programs. These efforts include supporting developing countries in integrating climate action into their national development plans and providing technical assistance and capacity building.\n\nThe National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China is working to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality by implementing strategic actions and technological layouts. This includes setting clear targets and timelines, developing policies to reduce emissions, and investing in renewable energy and green technologies.\n\nAnalysis of international carbon neutrality strategies and technological layouts offers valuable insights for developing countries, highlighting the importance of comprehensive policy frameworks, international cooperation, and innovation in clean technology. These insights can guide developing nations in formulating their own strategies and leveraging international support to meet their carbon neutrality goals.</learnings>\n"

The U.S. government has provided fiscal subsidies and tax incentives for hydrogen projects through policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act, promoting the application of hydrogen in transportation, industry, and power sectors. Additionally, the U.S. collaborates with the EU and other countries and regions on hydrogen technology standards and market access, jointly promoting the maturity and development of the global hydrogen market.\n\nDeveloping countries have gained technological and financial support through cooperation mechanisms with developed countries in achieving their carbon neutrality goals. For example, China and Germany have established long-term cooperation in renewable energy and energy efficiency improvement, with Germany providing advanced wind and solar technologies and solutions for energy efficiency improvement to China, helping China accelerate its clean energy transition. This cooperation not only enhances China's carbon reduction capabilities but also promotes mutual benefits and win-win outcomes in green technology between the two countries.\n\nUnder the carbon neutrality goal, international organizations and multilateral mechanisms have played a key role in promoting cooperation between developing and developed countries. Institutions such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank provide technical assistance, financial support, and policy guidance to help developing countries formulate and implement carbon neutrality strategies. These international organizations also promote South-South and North-South cooperation by establishing regional and global cooperation platforms, facilitating the sharing of technology and experience, and enhancing the synergistic effects of global carbon neutrality actions.\nDeveloping countries should focus on the flexibility and adaptability of policies in their carbon neutrality path planning. For example, China gradually expanded the pilot scope of its carbon trading market from local to national levels, gradually improving the mechanism to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the policy. This incremental policy design can reduce risks during implementation and leave room for future adjustments.\n\nSuccessful carbon neutrality path planning requires cross-sectoral collaboration. The EU's carbon reduction experience shows that the successful implementation of carbon neutrality policies depends on close cooperation among various government departments, enterprises, research institutions, and social organizations. For example, Germany established a multi-department coordination mechanism to ensure policy coherence and execution, effectively promoting the achievement of carbon reduction targets.\n\nTransparency and public participation are key to ensuring the effectiveness of carbon neutrality policies. India's carbon reduction experience indicates that governments should strengthen communication with the public, increase policy transparency, and encourage public participation when formulating and implementing carbon neutrality policies. By setting up dedicated public participation platforms and regularly publishing carbon reduction progress reports, India successfully enhanced public support and participation in carbon neutrality goals.\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) supports the intellectual property systems of developing countries, promoting innovation in sustainable development and carbon neutrality goals. Specific projects include providing technical assistance, capacity building, and knowledge dissemination to help these countries develop and utilize green technologies, thereby accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nChina has actively participated in global climate protection actions over the past decade, supporting developing countries in achieving their carbon neutrality goals through multilateral and bilateral cooperation mechanisms. For example, China provided financial and technical support through the South-South cooperation framework, helping African and Southeast Asian countries implement climate adaptation and mitigation projects, significantly enhancing their climate resilience.\n\nInternational organizations and non-governmental organizations have effectively integrated multiple resources by establishing public-private partnerships in promoting the carbon neutrality goals of developing countries. For example, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) cooperate to provide financing, technology transfer, and policy support, supporting renewable energy projects and carbon market construction in multiple countries, achieving significant environmental and social benefits.\nDeveloping countries need to balance economic development and environmental sustainability by implementing the principle of differentiated responsibilities when pursuing carbon neutrality goals. This principle emphasizes that developed countries should bear greater responsibility for emission reductions while providing technological and financial support to help developing countries achieve green transitions. For example, China's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement clearly states that it will peak carbon emissions before 2030 and strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, which requires broad support and cooperation from the international community.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability not only involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also promoting a green economy and technological innovation. Developing countries can achieve sustainable economic growth through measures such as developing clean energy, improving energy efficiency, and promoting green finance. For example, China's 14th Five-Year Plan proposes vigorously developing wind and solar energy and other renewable energies, while promoting energy efficiency improvements in industries, buildings, and transportation to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nTo achieve carbon neutrality goals, developing countries need to establish multi-level policy frameworks, including top-level design at the national level, implementation mechanisms at the local level, and innovative practices at the enterprise level. Policy frameworks should include clear carbon emission targets, carbon trading market construction, environmental regulations, and incentive measures. For example, China established a carbon trading market at the national level, promoting emission reductions through market mechanisms; at the local level, multiple provinces and cities have formulated specific carbon peak and carbon neutrality action plans; at the enterprise level, companies are encouraged to adopt low-carbon technologies and green production methods to achieve a win-win situation in economic and environmental benefits.</learnings>\n"

                "content": "Search learnings: <learnings>The provided contents do not directly address the research query on the causes of errors in simple computations by large models, particularly focusing on model architecture, training data, and optimization methods. However, the following key learnings can be extrapolated and may serve as a foundation for further research:\n\nThe phenomenon of 'emergent capabilities' in large models, where they exhibit unexpected and advanced behaviors, has been challenged with empirical counterexamples. Scientists have provided real-world instances where large models fail to perform simple tasks, suggesting that the complexity of the model architecture alone is not sufficient to ensure accuracy in all tasks. This highlights the need to critically evaluate model architectures and their limitations, especially in tasks that seem straightforward.\n\nPsychological explanations for the errors in large models suggest that human-like cognitive biases can emerge in these systems. This indicates that the training data, which often reflects human biases and errors, can propagate these issues into the model's outputs. Therefore, the quality and diversity of the training data are crucial in mitigating errors in simple computations.\n\nThe process of model compression, such as quantization, can introduce errors in large models, particularly in simple computations. Quantization reduces the precision of the model's parameters to make it more efficient, but this can lead to loss of information and increased error rates in tasks that require high precision. This suggests that optimization methods, including those used for model compression, must be carefully selected and evaluated to ensure they do not compromise the model's performance on simple tasks.\nLarge models perform well in complex reasoning tasks, partly due to their architectural design, such as the Mixture of Experts (MoE) system, which effectively allocates computational resources through sparse activation mechanisms, thereby improving inference efficiency while maintaining model size. A study from Tsinghua University points out that the MoE architecture significantly reduces computational complexity during inference by dynamically selecting expert sub-models for computation, making large models more efficient in handling complex reasoning tasks.\n\nThe diversity and scale of training data significantly impact the reasoning capabilities of large models. High-quality, large-scale training data provide rich patterns and contextual information, enabling models to exhibit stronger generalization and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. For example, large pre-training datasets like WebText and Wikipedia not only contain vast amounts of textual information but also cover multiple languages and domains, which is crucial for enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities.\n\nOptimization methods play a critical role in the training and inference processes of large models. Efficient optimization algorithms, such as adaptive learning rate methods (e.g., Adam, Adagrad) and gradient clipping techniques, effectively improve training efficiency and stability. Additionally, techniques like model pruning and quantization further optimize the computational efficiency of models during inference, allowing large models to achieve efficient inference in practical applications. For instance, reducing redundant parameters through model pruning can significantly reduce computational load without significantly compromising performance.\n\nThe efficiency of model architectures in handling simple calculations versus complex reasoning varies significantly. Simple calculation tasks typically rely on the forward propagation process, which has low computational complexity, while complex reasoning tasks require multi-step logical processing and deep learning mechanisms, leading to significantly higher computational complexity and resource consumption.\n\nSeparated inference architectures (such as DistServe) can effectively enhance the inference efficiency of large-scale models by separating compute-intensive tasks and inference tasks. This architecture allows computational tasks to be distributed across different hardware, enabling parallel processing, significantly reducing inference time, and improving overall system performance.\n\nIn mathematical reasoning tasks, the choice between performing complex computations during training or inference has a significant impact on performance and resource utilization. Performing complex computations during training can preprocess data, reducing the computational burden during inference, but may increase training time and resource consumption; conversely, performing computations during inference can reduce training burden but may face higher computational latency and resource demands in practical applications.\nTraining data complexity significantly impacts model performance, with more complex data generally leading to better performance in tasks requiring deep reasoning, but at the cost of increased computational resources and training time. Simple calculations in training data can be sufficient for tasks that do not require complex reasoning, making them more efficient and cost-effective, but they may fall short in scenarios where nuanced understanding is crucial. The choice between simple calculations and complex reasoning during training should be guided by the specific requirements of the downstream tasks, balancing the trade-offs between performance, resource consumption, and training efficiency.\nOptimization methods can significantly enhance computational efficiency in handling mathematical problems, especially in complex reasoning tasks. By performing computations during inference rather than training, more flexible and efficient model responses can be achieved. For example, in Large Model 2.0, this strategy enables the model to dynamically adjust computational resources when handling complex problems, thus improving inference speed and accuracy.\n\nIn the new paradigm of integrating learning and reasoning in large models, optimization methods go beyond traditional computational acceleration and involve innovations in algorithms and architectures. For instance, discussions in the DeepSeek technology community on logical inference strategy selection demonstrate how optimized algorithm design can enable models to more effectively utilize computational resources, reduce redundant computations, and enhance overall performance.\n\nThe application of optimization methods in handling mathematical problems also involves balancing simple calculations and complex reasoning. By introducing optimization strategies at the model design stage, computational efficiency can be ensured while enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. For example, Wang Xiong mentions in his blog post on ScienceNet that through optimized algorithms and model architectures, resource consumption can be reduced when handling simple calculations, and computational precision and speed can be improved when handling complex reasoning tasks, thus achieving more efficient task processing.</learnings>\n"

The MoE architecture allocates inputs across different computation paths, allowing the model to call specific expert modules when needed, thus demonstrating higher flexibility and efficiency in handling complex tasks while reducing unnecessary computation costs in simple tasks.\n\nThe DeepSeek MoE architecture performs well in large-scale language models by optimizing the selection and scheduling strategies of expert modules, further enhancing model performance. DeepSeek MoE introduces an adaptive routing mechanism that dynamically adjusts the use of expert modules for different tasks and inputs, thereby maintaining efficient computation while improving accuracy and robustness in complex reasoning tasks.\n\nDistributed inference architectures like DistServe significantly improve the inference speed and scalability of large models by decomposing the model into multiple sub-modules and processing them in parallel on different devices. DistServe optimizes data flow management and cross-device communication, enabling efficient handling of large-scale model inference tasks in distributed environments, particularly in high-concurrency and low-latency application scenarios.\nThe diversity and quality of training data significantly affect the performance of large models in simple calculations and complex reasoning. For example, the WebText dataset, with its wide range of sources and content diversity, can significantly enhance the model's performance in complex reasoning tasks, while the Wikipedia dataset, known for its high accuracy and structured content, excels in simple calculation tasks.\n\nThe source and quality control mechanisms of datasets directly impact model performance. WebText ensures the breadth and diversity of data by crawling diverse content from the internet, but it also requires rigorous cleaning and noise reduction. In contrast, the Wikipedia dataset ensures high-quality and accurate data through community editing and review mechanisms, but may lack diversity in certain areas.\n\nBalancing the scale and diversity of datasets is crucial. Large-scale datasets provide rich training samples, enhancing the model's generalization ability, but overly large and diverse datasets may introduce noise and inconsistencies, affecting training outcomes. Therefore, selecting datasets of appropriate scale and diversity is key to optimizing model performance.\nAdaptive learning rate methods optimize the training process of large models by dynamically adjusting the learning rate, thereby ensuring convergence speed while reducing training time and resource consumption. For example, the Adam optimizer, by combining momentum and adaptive learning rates, can more effectively find global optima in complex optimization landscapes, particularly when dealing with large datasets and high-dimensional parameter spaces.\n\nModel pruning techniques significantly reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity by removing redundant neurons or connections, thereby improving inference efficiency on low-performance hardware. For instance, structured pruning methods can reduce model size by over 50% while maintaining performance, while sparse pruning can increase inference speed by 2-3 times without significantly impacting model accuracy.\n\nQuantization techniques further reduce storage and computational requirements by converting model parameters and activation values from high-precision floating-point numbers to low-precision integers, enhancing inference efficiency. For example, 8-bit quantization can reduce storage requirements by 4 times and increase computation speed by 1.5-2 times during inference, particularly in embedded devices and edge computing scenarios.\nLarge models primarily rely on forward propagation for simple calculations, performing efficient numerical computations using neural network weights and biases, a process typically completed within a few milliseconds, suitable for fast response and high-throughput scenarios.\n\nWhen handling complex reasoning tasks, large models need to perform multi-step logical processing, involving the activation and feedback mechanisms of multiple layers and maintaining and updating internal states over multiple time steps. This process may take longer but can handle more complex logic and contextual information.\n\nThe main difference between forward propagation and multi-step logical processing lies in the fact that forward propagation is a unidirectional, static computation process, while multi-step logical processing is a dynamic, interactive reasoning process. The latter can iteratively and interactively approach the solution to a problem, making it suitable for tasks requiring deep understanding and reasoning.</learnings>\n"

A study by the University of California, San Francisco, demonstrated that machine learning algorithms could predict which patients were likely to develop severe symptoms, allowing for proactive resource allocation and treatment planning. This approach not only improved patient outcomes but also optimized the use of limited medical resources.\n\nThe integration of real-time data from multiple sources, including social media, electronic health records, and environmental data, provided a comprehensive view of the pandemic's dynamics. This multifaceted approach, as seen in the work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), enabled researchers to track the spread of the virus more effectively and identify emerging hotspots. The use of these integrated data sources also highlighted the importance of data standardization and interoperability, which remain significant challenges in the field.\nReal-time data analysis and machine learning in retail during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled dynamic pricing strategies, allowing retailers like Walmart to adjust prices in real-time based on supply chain disruptions and demand fluctuations, optimizing profit margins while maintaining customer satisfaction.\n\nInnovative use of machine learning for inventory management and demand forecasting helped companies such as Amazon and Target to predict and manage stock levels more accurately, reducing overstock and out-of-stock scenarios by up to 20%, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience.\n\nMachine learning-driven personalization and recommendation engines, implemented by retailers like Shopify and Macy's, significantly boosted online sales by providing tailored shopping experiences, increasing conversion rates by 15% and average order values by 10%, despite the challenges of reduced in-store traffic.\nReal-time data analysis and machine learning models in UK financial institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated significant adaptability, with firms like Barclays and HSBC rapidly deploying predictive models to forecast market volatility and customer behavior, leading to a 20% improvement in risk assessment accuracy.\n\nInnovations in data infrastructure and cloud computing, particularly through partnerships with tech giants like AWS and Google Cloud, enabled financial firms to handle the unprecedented surge in data volume and complexity, resulting in a 30% reduction in data processing time and enhanced scalability.\n\nChallenges included the need for robust data governance and compliance frameworks to address regulatory concerns and ensure data privacy, with companies like Lloyds Banking Group investing heavily in advanced encryption and anonymization techniques, which increased their operational costs by 15% but significantly reduced the risk of data breaches.\nAmazon's AI-Driven Supply Chain successfully leveraged machine learning to optimize inventory management and demand forecasting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Three Peaks were featured on the TV programme 'Seven Natural Wonders' as one of the wonders of Yorkshire. Yorkshire Three Peaks The hills of Whernside, Ingleborough, and Pen-y-ghent are collectively known as the Three Peaks. The peaks,\nDoc 3(Title: Ingleborough) are listed here, clockwise from north, with their distance in miles and bearing in degrees. The furthest peak visible is Manod Mawr in Snowdonia, North Wales, 70 miles away on a bearing of 218 degrees. Ingleborough Ingleborough is the second-highest mountain in the Yorkshire Dales. It is one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks (the other two being Whernside and Pen-y-ghent), and is frequently climbed as part of the Three Peaks walk. The first element of the name 'Ingleborough' has been variably explained as a Scots term for 'beacon, fire', an Old Danish term meaning 'English' or a derivative of Old English\n</learnings>\n"

In 1962, he became the first African-American student admitted to the segregated University of Mississippi, after the intervention of the federal government, an event that was a flashpoint in the Civil Rights Movement. Inspired by President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address, Meredith decided to exercise his constitutional rights and apply to the University of Mississippi. His goal was to put pressure on the Kennedy administration to enforce civil rights for African Americans.

The Mississippi Legislature chartered the University of Mississippi on February 24, 1844. The university opened its doors to its first class of 80 students four years later in 1848. For 23 years, the university was Mississippi's only public institution of higher learning, and for 110 years it was the state's only comprehensive university.

By the fall of 1965 both Ole Miss and Mississippi State University had been integrated – the former violently, the latter peacefully. University of Southern Mississippi leaders, such as President William David McCain, had come to realize that the battle to maintain segregation was lost. Therefore,\n</learnings>\n"
