Top hosts like Li Jiaqi and Viya have a large fan base, and their recommendations can quickly convert into sales. In the United States and Europe, although there are influential figures, their influence and conversion rates are far less than those of Chinese hosts.",
        "China's relatively loose regulatory environment provides space for the rapid development of the live streaming e-commerce industry, but it also leads to frequent market chaos. In contrast, the stricter regulatory environment in the United States and Europe may inhibit its development but also ensures higher consumer trust and market transparency.",
